[18:16] <theluigiguy> LUL
[18:16] <somerandomsatanic> LUL ok
[18:17] <volbia> he sounds like a mix of russian and indian stereotype accents
[18:17] <nimmymoo> What a motley crue this is.

[18:18] <kingsableye> I love the fucking jump through the window
[18:18] <somerandomsatanic> great jump
[18:18] <titos2k> that overreacted jump
[18:19] <robrobrevolution> So do you find his mothers head and kill it?
[18:19] <johnrawrallday> They delayed the game to add a story mode if I remember correctly. BUT I could be wrong
[18:19] <ryanviews> Think it's cool there's multiple ways to win.
[18:19] <nick2424delcat> HI CHAT
[18:19] <weer_dough> I swear twitch has special selective hearing. Every time Rev shouts "He's here!" it buffers.

[18:20] <dubemo> rev is part of the KKK - the Kool Kids Klub Kappa
[18:20] <somerandomsatanic> Hello @Sadistic_Kitten BegWan
[18:20] <ryanviews> Never stop doing that jump. No one can stop it, not even Jason.
[18:20] <dubemo> LUL
[18:20] <meawz> taking a shot every time Rev jumps through a window
[18:20] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[18:20] <freakxwannaxbe> don't sacrifice looking cool just because you're about to die
[18:20] <titos2k> window jumper 2017

[18:20] <mega5000> it was rev in the billiard room with the wrench Kappa
[18:20] <weer_dough> "Hey" "Goodbye"
[18:20] <robrobrevolution> The stereotype horror music really adds to the ResidentSleeper
[18:21] <biggus_fishus> The door is locked, but that window is wide open
[18:21] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow can I Still buy a gopter shirt
[18:21] <kingsableye> Rev, what are your thoughts on PUBG with mods? ArgieB8
[18:21] <weer_dough> Rev maybe if you kill the others and offer them to Jason he won't kill you.
[18:21] <johnrawrallday> @Dubemo I literally just played a rocket league match with someone who had that as their username.
[18:21] <somerandomsatanic> Rob, not gonna lie it does
[18:21] <freakxwannaxbe> o dude that music is intense
[18:21] <ryanviews> This music is pretty top notch.
[18:21] <volbia> I've never understood the space symbol |_| what is that?
[18:21] <dickmandrake> Horror music is just weird when there's nothin happening
[18:21] <somerandomsatanic> its so intense LUL
[18:21] <kingsableye> The underscore?
[18:22] <somerandomsatanic> _ kinda like a space for coding
[18:22] <stahlmagie> Rip girl.
[18:22] <kingsableye> yeah
[18:22] <boscojokey> this game should play man behind the mask when jasons nearby
[18:22] <kingsableye> that's a good way to put it
[18:22] <hurricanebady> that person your playing as looks like you, rev

[18:35] <freakxwannaxbe> all the campers turn against omar, i'm absolutely for seeing that
[18:35] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow wait don't kill him or he will just ghost easier then

[18:38] <someblueguyinchat> Ethan from H3H3 had a good rule of thumn: If you can't explain why someone on YouTube is popular, the answer is almost always kids
[18:38] <jimblesjumbles> Cave his skull in.

[18:42] <dickmandrake> I can't believe that JonTron is dead OpieOP
[18:42] <sir_noobsly> @spookyoogie jason does that
[18:42] <dondoran85> man, you didn't even hit him with the sword FeelsBadMan
[18:42] <papanade69> Lol this dude is awesome
[18:42] <sladuog> OpieOP
[18:42] <somedwarf> Did they nerf run-girl
[18:42] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow you choked on your fruit punch rev Kappa
[18:42] <thevaultboy1235> Mashstar is best jason
[18:42] <johnrawrallday> Oh yeah Jason can teleport
[18:42] <will99222> @RevScarecrow take this time to try fix the push to talk?
[18:42] <zarkith> ^^^
[18:42] <weer_dough> I didn't see it but I DID see the ad for Prey for the thousandth time with amazing timing.
[18:42] <dubemo> At least he was nice enough to give you a head start
[18:43] <somerandomsatanic> push to talk is broken NotLikeThis
[18:43] <sladuog> GOOD SHOT LL
[18:43] <ryanviews> Really, in this situation, Jason was the hero. That flannel is really bad.
[18:43] <siggiee> atleast he told you not to hide under the beat
[18:43] <siggiee> *bed
[18:43] <boscojokey> can you play as jason X in this game?
[18:43] <kodamann> yes
[18:43] <pastaroniravioli> "its not you, its the flannel"
[18:43] <will99222> @RevScarecrow check if its enabled in the audio settinghs
[18:43] <somedwarf> "mute copyrighted music"
[18:43] <sky8moon> do you have to exit the game ur in to edit it?
[18:43] <zombiehunter6022> man totalbiscuit won't like that
[18:43] <tyler81198> maybe not in-game
[18:43] <sladuog> and this is why illfonic were kicked off the FPS mode of star citizen LUL
[18:43] <bechuga> you should have run outside, loop the building, go back in and straight under the bed
[18:44] <cartoonairman> Yes. Game is garbage unless Jason X is a skin.
[18:44] <sladuog> *developing
[18:44] <thefocuswobbler> @RevScarecrow Do you think purple jumpsuit Jason should be a costume for the game?
[18:44] <zarkith> Maybe keybind editing is in the day one patch? :shrug:
[18:44] <thelonelyelsen> @revscarecrow maybe is because youre ingame
[18:44] <somedwarf> You just canceled the change for PTT btw
[18:44] <mad_dawg_o> only now i saw omar channel not only does he have a punchable voice but a face aswell
[18:44] <boscojokey> @kodamann is there a jason X map?
[18:44] <ryanviews> No rebinding keys. :(
[18:44] <kodamann> no
[18:44] <somerandomsatanic> maybe exit the game?
[18:44] <will99222> @RevScarecrow you cancelled the change to push to talk instead of accepting it
[18:44] <sky8moon> I just saw a video someone using push to talk though so it should work
[18:44] <kodamann> @revscarecrow in the binding screen press on the key instead of the input
[18:44] <titos2k> so its a twitch streamers closed beta thing?
[18:45] <will99222> @RevScarecrow maybe you cant change it inside a match
[18:45] <tyler81198> probably not in-game
[18:45] <stahlmagie> Rev prefers coffee to T.
[18:45] <somerandomsatanic> Why T?
[18:45] <zarkith> Tea is great though
[18:45] <zombiehunter6022> x is fine
[18:45] <thelonelyelsen> R.I.P asmr stream
[18:45] <squirrellilly> Gross
[18:45] <kodamann> illfonic are the creators
[18:45] <reply_mail> @RevScarecrow you might be able to change they keys when not in game
[18:45] <somedwarf> The friday the 13th clan
[18:45] <boscojokey> is there a NES jason skin?
[18:45] <squirrellilly> I use tilde
[18:45] <will99222> @RevScarecrow maybe you cant change the button binding inside the game

[18:45] <tyler81198> i hate binding anything to caps, because caps means turning on caps
[18:45] <sladuog> they developed the sonic boom multiplayer too LUL
[18:46] <thefocuswobbler> @boscojokey That what I said, it would be really cool!
[18:46] <kingsableye> one shot gurl seems like a decent YTer
[18:46] <zombiehunter6022> thank god those assholes left
[18:46] <lightdasher> she needs a hug
[18:46] <squirrellilly> What @Will99222 said.
[18:46] <mithos56> There was a special preorder jason Ithink
[18:46] <stahlmagie> Man, she took some hits, but Rev just got choked once and died.
[18:46] <dickmandrake> Game is fun again SeemsGood
[18:46] <dondoran85> yeah, watching one_shot_gurl too, she's alright
[18:46] <bechuga> if caps locks is on does that mean you have to shout
[18:46] <zarkith> Anyone's alright after *shudders* Omar
[18:46] <reply_mail> @RevScarecrow use your main finger
[18:46] <kingsableye> Also, I'll catch you all later, have to head to Uni. Have a good one everyone!
[18:46] <zarkith> I'll take PewDiePie over him
[18:46] <sladuog> >the gun just floats on your back
[18:46] <faldenvi> Cya Sableye
[18:46] <titos2k> where's our boy omar?
[18:47] <shuuspillow> just like in real life
[18:47] <kodamann> this game has good assets
[18:47] <lunchonbreak> He's gone
[18:47] <cartoonairman> Dat doppler music.
[18:47] <stahlmagie> Drogith with the jukes.
[18:47] <rmhgreen123> I hope they add jason x in an update
[18:47] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow hi daddy, I subbed to you again
[18:47] <theluigiguy> bye @kingsableye
[18:47] <zarkith> And Omar's style is "cancer"
[18:47] <thevaultboy1235> dead
[18:47] <sladuog> defenestrated
[18:47] <johnrawrallday> Mashstars in for the kill
[18:47] <ryanviews> "Oh you wanted through the window, here you go."
[18:47] <somedwarf> That's a pretty flaccid murder Jason, not gonna lie
[18:47] <outsiderxt> More like refenestrated.
[18:47] <mad_dawg_o> is omar streaming right now?
[18:47] <will99222> @sladuog thats out the window. this was En-Fenestrated
[18:47] <squirrellilly> Actively cheating.
[18:47] <werewhiskey_> no, i think it's perfectly justified to be mean like that about someone's playstyle if their playstyle is "being a ghosting asshole"
[18:47] <squirrellilly> That's not a style, rev.
[18:47] <icedhermit> The execution almost seemed tame compared to the others.
[18:47] <kiwitheiguana> Playstyles are like opinions, as soon as yours begins messing up other people you are a prick
[18:47] <grahf_seekerofpower> @RevScarecrow theres a difference between "their own style" nd "obnoxious asshole"
[18:48] <thetoxicavenger666> @RevScarecrow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPZr5Kkam9k I found appropriate metal for this
[18:48] <papanade69> I think I've seen Luigikids YouTube videos before. They are extremely cringey
[18:48] <lunchonbreak> diito
[18:48] <cartoonairman> When do I put the 3D glasses on? Where are the scenes made painfully obviously for the 3D?
[18:48] <ryanviews> I think I heard of Luigikid before, but I don't remember where.
[18:48] <sladuog> I never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence, and omar seemed extremely incompetent LUL
[18:48] <will99222> @RevScarecrow you need to change them OUTSIDE the match.
[18:48] <somedwarf> Click on the keys themselves?
[18:48] <thefocuswobbler> Did you set it to WOMBO?
[18:48] <kingsableye> Or maybe you have to go to the Config file
[18:48] <kodamann> presss on the key rev, for instance combat stance: c press on the 'c" @RevScarecrow
[18:48] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow ask
[18:48] <werewhiskey_> vineLoog vineLoog2 vineLoog3
[18:48] <kodamann> ya ding a ling
[18:49] <sladuog> light a flare turn around three times, do a backlfip and hold the push to talk key

[18:50] <theluigiguy> hi Alex
[18:50] <slipshodian> next time you gotta be like "harder daddy" so Jason stops the choke hold for a moment

[18:50] <volbia> it really does seem that way
[18:50] <flametitan> that ragdoll
[18:50] <dickmandrake> Nice Deathrattle
[18:50] <somerandomsatanic> its meh
[18:50] <thefocuswobbler> What if Batman fought Jason?
[18:50] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[18:50] <zombiehunter6022> btw enmime is currently in a legal Case against a party in new Zealand because they the song one shot
[18:50] <lightdasher> You should play this with Geep and Kim c:
[18:51] <will99222> >neutered
[18:51] <somedwarf> Complaining consuelers will be TOSSED
[18:51] <boscojokey> @thefocuswobbler batman would win
[18:51] <thelonelyelsen> Jason surely is a good boy
[18:51] <papanade69> That rag doll was perfectly timed
[18:51] <zombiehunter6022> they used the song *
[18:51] <titos2k> doesn't look this bad tho
[18:51] <thevaultboy1235> You just need players like mashstar to have fun
[18:51] <ryanviews> Yeah, it doesn't seem bad. I dunno, need to see more, I guess!
[18:51] <hurricanebady> well, im having fun watching ya
[18:51] <will99222> @RevScarecrow CLICK THE LETTER
[18:51] <will99222> @RevScarecrow NOT THE COMMAND
[18:51] <robrobrevolution> cool it with the caps will99222
[18:51] <thefocuswobbler> Jason is HARDER, better, FASTER, stronger
[18:51] <dondoran85> Rev is not very good at menus
[18:51] <siggiee> I enjoy Criken's vids on this game
[18:51] <sky8moon> if you hold a shiv you can escape him
[18:51] <asstastic420> hey Rev and chat
[18:51] <will99222> sorry for caps its been said like 10x even by himself.
[18:52] <wavedazumarill> Teleporting seems messed up though
[18:52] <somerandomsatanic> Hey @asstastic420
[18:52] <will99222> ok.
[18:52] <robrobrevolution> dont need to beat a dead horse
[18:52] <lunchonbreak> The dude is huge too
[18:52] <will99222> yeah it must need to be outside of match
[18:52] <theluigiguy> hi @asstastic420
[18:52] <kodamann> The point of jason being overpowered is that the campers need to work as a team to actually fight him, divided they are picked off rather easily
[18:52] <somerandomsatanic> FailFish good controls
[18:52] <will99222> the most spoken about thing for the last 10 minutes was the push to talk changing. seems far from dead.
[18:52] <mithos56> I don't think people know how to play as campers yet
[18:52] <thefocuswobbler> Does the warp have a time and cool down?
[18:52] <kodamann> it's basically a horror trope, like they said in scream "if you say "i'll be right back" you won't be coming back" meaning if you're alone you're dead
[18:52] <vagueparade> Spanish Inquisition vs Jason
[18:53] <lunchonbreak> Getting randos to work together is easier said than done
[18:53] <boscojokey> @kodamann teamwork?! IN A VIDEO GAME?!
[18:53] <thevaultboy1235> Well maybe they'll patch it soon
[18:53] <thefocuswobbler> @VagueParade Jason
[18:53] <icedhermit> At least remove the short-range warp. The random teleport could be alright.
[18:53] <zombiehunter6022> anyone interested in the apocalypse now game?
[18:53] <kodamann> @boscojokey it's like left 4 dead, most of the time if you play in a pub game you'll get cunts, play in a private game and it's amazing
[18:53] <titos2k> i think this game needs more RP elements.
[18:54] <thefocuswobbler> What if there were TWO Jason's!!!

[19:03] <ryanviews> Okay, yeah, that ability is trash.
[19:03] <thestarryskye> @thefocuswobbler the opposite is true, being naked makes Jason's aim better

[19:03] <kodamann> @ryanviews not meant to be
[19:03] <thefocuswobbler> @TheStarrySkye BibleThump
[19:03] <slipshodian> i think it needs a cooldown or something
[19:03] <shuuspillow> "Your dead body"
[19:03] <zephyreth> it's not meant to be fair
[19:03] <johnrawrallday> @Zephyreth I feel that
[19:03] <papajojohnswackytour> nope
[19:03] <thefocuswobbler> Yeah, i think it needs longer cooldowns
[19:03] <ryanviews> I mean, sure it's not supposed to be fair, you should be at a disadvantage.
[19:03] <lpgdlf> cool plan
[19:04] <kodamann> juked
[19:04] <stahlmagie> Skillfull.
[19:04] <nc006> you where about to rat rev lol
[19:04] <ryanviews> But you're just dead with that teleport.
[19:04] <honoluluroscoe> Sup gang? How's this game going? Would you say it's better or worse than Dead by Daylight?
[19:04] <lpgdlf> he might be stuck in the animation
[19:04] <carbonic0> hello, i was just about to ask that lol
[19:04] <papanade69> So far we are at worse
[19:04] <slipshodian> well, i mean jason should have the advantage, but the teleports need a big cooldown or something
[19:04] <johnrawrallday> Survive italian bro!
[19:04] <rmhgreen123> You can do it italyman!
[19:04] <carbonic0> this game looks way better then dead by dayligh
[19:04] <pksalsa> no snitchin cmonBruh
[19:04] <thestarryskye> dead by daylight at least looks better
[19:04] <zephyreth> you are supposed to jump in and out of the houses instead of running around in the middle of nowhere wasting stamina
[19:04] <carbonic0> visually speaking
[19:04] <thefocuswobbler> @HonoluluRoscoe I showed up like 30 min ago and I think I overhyped it for myself.
[19:04] <thestarryskye> visually
[19:04] <ckqcy> ded
[19:04] <papajojohnswackytour> uh
[19:04] <kodamann> you can't fix the generator i believe if he breaks it, only when it is initally broken
[19:04] <zombiehunter6022> Italian bro is better than omar
[19:04] <thestarryskye> @Carbonic0 well now we have to fight
[19:05] <papajojohnswackytour> what

[19:05] <ryanviews> Jason is just going for a jog.
[19:05] <ilasja> why'd he move
[19:05] <stahlmagie> Jason not doing the best job.
[19:05] <johnrawrallday> @RevScarecrow It seems like they are working on balancing in that case and weighted it too much to the Jason side
[19:05] <bechuga> is Jason a form of Dio from Jojo
[19:05] <thestarryskye> @Carbonic0 I use Pot of Greed

[19:06] <bechuga> or italian dude is a hacker
[19:06] <shuuspillow> jason is pushing like 50 okay
[19:06] <thefocuswobbler> @JohnRawRallday I kind of want it to where Jason is powerful, but not over powered
[19:06] <bechuga> or lag
[19:06] <lpgdlf> he may have first person vision

[19:06] <pksalsa> PogChamp
[19:06] <honoluluroscoe> Have any of you guys seen Tucker and Dale vs Evil? This situation gives me the impression that Jason is just a nice dude hiding his disfigurment with a hockey mask, while he goes for a jog.
[19:06] <lolzeroniandcheese> yo rev what ya playing today?
[19:06] <ryanviews> Well, we haven't seen Jason's point of view, so maybe he has a restricted field of view?

[19:07] <will99222> https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantPoisedCardPunchTrees
[19:07] <theluigiguy> Maybe run into the wild so Jason completely loses line of sight when he gets back up
[19:07] <boscojokey> is that fred from scooby doo?
[19:07] <somerandomsatanic> @TheStarrySkye best theory
[19:07] <lpgdlf> literally shitting himself
[19:07] <stahlmagie> Arrest him, Jason wouldn't disobey the law.
[19:07] <somerandomsatanic> LUL
[19:07] <thestarryskye> @SomeRandomSatanic thank
[19:07] <bechuga> wouldn't jason just teleport out of the cuff
[19:08] <lightdasher> What would you change, based on your playtime so far, Rev?
[19:08] <spotulip> I kind of liked the twist of the original Friday the 13th
[19:08] <honoluluroscoe> I realize it's just part of the game, but if Jason shrugged off a point blank shotgun blast from Italy-bro, what are small town cops going to do?
[19:08] <squirrellilly> Game Theory, Jason is DADDY
[19:08] <carbonic0> doesnt the first movie have a needless sex scene?
[19:08] <cartoonairman> Don't they all?
[19:08] <stahlmagie> He can't teleport out of them, that's illegal.
[19:08] <carbonic0> Game Theory: JASON IS A TRANSGENDER XENOMORPH!?
[19:08] <somerandomsatanic> "Roleplayer" LUL
[19:08] <thefocuswobbler> @JohnRawRallday I hope they fix it so I can get my hype back
[19:08] <thestarryskye> @SquirrelLilly please no
[19:08] <ryanviews> Jason just has a super sex radar for murdering purposes.
[19:08] <siggiee> 80s, wild times for film
[19:08] <lpgdlf> you should be able to scare jason by flinging a buch of rocks at him
[19:08] <papanade69> Omar was the type of horror movie character that you hope dies off
[19:09] <prob_rob> Game Theory: Jason isn't a hockey player
[19:09] <honoluluroscoe> @Carbonic0 most of the movies have needless sex scenes. Friday the 13th kinda started the trope of teenagers getting murdered after gratuitous sex
[19:09] <lpgdlf> bunch*
[19:09] <somerandomsatanic> ????
[19:09] <pksalsa> LUL
[19:09] <carbonic0> oh man, really? thats neat
[19:09] <zephyreth> because they are stupid
[19:09] <lightdasher> ??????
[19:09] <somedwarf> LOL
[19:09] <ryanviews> I am so confused.
[19:09] <theluigiguy> ???
[19:09] <asstastic420> this game is a mess NotLikeThis
[19:09] <stahlmagie> This is so absurd.
[19:09] <zephyreth> they are being stupid
[19:09] <hugo756> LUL hahahahaha wow
[19:09] <papajojohnswackytour> this game is beauty
[19:09] <robrobrevolution> Bug spray fixes traps
[19:09] <will99222> wtf is going on?
[19:09] <somerandomsatanic> This game omfg FailFish
[19:09] <faldenvi> But ???????
[19:09] <thestarryskye> is Jason an AI in this??
[19:09] <theadamantarchvile> Let me put some aeosol on that wound
[19:09] <bechuga> are they crouching because they're tired?
[19:09] <ryanviews> I don't remember Jason being blind being a thing in the movies.
[19:09] <battle300> is jason a t-rex
[19:09] <carbonic0> i heard somewhere in the many sequels of friday the 13th jason goes to space and becomes a cyborg then comes back to the camp to kill everyone
[19:09] <theluigiguy> oh I see
[19:09] <somerandomsatanic> Sky, no
[19:09] <honoluluroscoe> @TheStarrySkye I hope not
[19:09] <theluigiguy> anyways RIP
[19:09] <thefocuswobbler> TOMMY NO!!!!!!
[19:09] <xing1870> kekekekek

[19:09] <meawz> i love this kid
[19:09] <somerandomsatanic> LUL omg
[19:09] <theluigiguy> That was almost the RP voice
[19:09] <zephyreth> at least try to crouch in a bush or something not in plain sight
[19:09] <ryanviews> Italian guy is great.
[19:09] <vagueparade> LUL
[19:09] <boryanov> LUL
[19:09] <thestarryskye> @Carbonic0 Jason X is what you're thinking of
[19:09] <bechuga> in the end, it doesn't really matter
[19:09] <honoluluroscoe> Italia bro is awesome
[19:09] <johnrawrallday> @thefocuswobbler didn't they also delay it a bit and are releasing a campaign?
[19:09] <lightdasher> Here we have a wild human gathering water
[19:10] <drcoxn183> oh hay
[19:10] <carbonic0> can we do a watch party of jason x then?
[19:10] <johnrawrallday> Italian guy is best
[19:10] <rmhgreen123> Serenade us italy bro
[19:10] <johnrawrallday> Bring him on stream
[19:10] <pksalsa> I like that Jason's animations are mocapped from the real Jason
[19:10] <shuuspillow> same
[19:10] <prob_rob> We all love him, man
[19:10] <thestarryskye> Volscente
[19:10] <zarkith> We gotta see at least one round of you as Jason
[19:10] <morings> volcente?
[19:10] <squirrellilly> Tell Italian Guy we love him very much and want him to guest on your streams.
[19:10] <vagueparade> Rev get him to say RP Kappa
[19:10] <drcoxn183> how long has this been on ?
[19:10] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow how does one play in italian?
[19:10] <morings> volscente yes that
[19:10] <hugo756> Volscente
[19:10] <honoluluroscoe> @RevScarecrow Are you thinking of switching to PUBG? I just got a new mouse, and I'm probably going to end up getting it
[19:10] <wilmothebear> Can we just call him Mario?
[19:10] <tyler81198> watching shitty late horror movies is terrible in the best ways, it's hilarious.
[19:10] <pastaroniravioli> italian dude was nice af
[19:10] <ryanviews> Can't wait to play the RP servers in this game. :P
[19:10] <theluigiguy> The atmosphere is great
[19:10] <faldenvi> Yes, Rev, share our love for Italian bro with him
[19:10] <papanade69> I'm VERY tempted to find Italian dude YouTube/Twitch channel to check out his stuff
[19:10] <ilasja> tell italian guy we love him!!
[19:10] <trekkie313> Baby Hazel?
[19:10] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Flash games: Getting a Virus - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[19:10] <zephyreth> a lot? don't you mean most?
[19:11] <tyler81198> friday the 13th for the snes?
[19:11] <rmhgreen123> Aliens colonial marines?
[19:11] <cartoonairman> Yeah. There's a lot of love in this game.
[19:11] <mithos56> They were actually working on the game BEFORE they got the license. The creator saw what they were doing, and offered the license to them
[19:11] <sir_noobsly> it's because they love jason that theu made him overpowered, so it's ok
[19:11] <morings> what are you thinking of playing the next rev?
[19:11] <will99222> @Rmhgreen123 Alien Isolation though.
[19:11] <sir_noobsly> Kappa
[19:11] <shuuspillow> name one good movie tie in in a vidya game
[19:11] <trekkie313> This girl is from Part 5... <3
[19:11] <will99222> @shuuspillow Alien Isolation?
[19:11] <skylerthemaster> Spider ma 2 for ps2
[19:11] <lpgdlf> they look like they came out of mass effect andromeda
[19:11] <ryanviews> Yeah, respect to the original property is totally shown. Just needs some cleaning up and rebalancing, I think.
[19:11] <tiphias> they are very faithful to the license, they just don't know how to make a good game
[19:11] <lightdasher> imagine if they did an Alien game with this concept
[19:11] <flametitan> Being accurate is not necessarily a good game
[19:12] <sladuog> @tiphias, true
[19:12] <zarkith> Found 'talian guy's YT channel. Dude only has 1/10th as many subs as Omar :(
[19:12] <thefocuswobbler> All of my friends in college really want to play this game, but since I'm the guy who needs to stay up to date with this, I'm not sure that they might play it for a month.
[19:12] <thestarryskye> what
[19:12] <sladuog> at least it's not another nexuiz
[19:12] <papanade69> Spoiler alert: Jason wins
[19:12] <pastaroniravioli> @Lightdasher the thought of that makes me tpBulk
[19:12] <thefocuswobbler> I would play it for a good while, but I'm a horror fan. Still...
[19:12] <morings> @Zarkith he deserves 10x as many as omar
[19:12] <ryanviews> The only way you can beat Jason: Pretend to be his mom and scold him. :P
[19:12] <reply_mail> !cheer 50 Rev, can you play My Elite Summer Valley Sniper?
[19:12] <thestarryskye> did Jason's mom sacrifice herself to a satanic ritual to rezz him
[19:12] <ilasja> yaaaaayyyyyy

[19:15] <somerandomsatanic> @Trekkie313 yeah
[19:15] <honoluluroscoe> @Trekkie313 I assume so. If not it's an extremely racist stereotype
[19:15] <theluigiguy> GivePLZ protect Volscente
[19:15] <thestarryskye> @Zarkith and volscente gaming?
[19:15] <luketriton> My beautiful italian boy
[19:15] <squirrellilly> Search Volscente it's the first two hits <3
[19:15] <bechuga> save the stamina
[19:15] <macabrepuppet> we must protect him
[19:15] <pastaroniravioli> BYPE
[19:15] <will99222> @RevScarecrow is closing doors behind you like in PUBG a good idea?
[19:15] <zarkith> That's his main channel, but he's got his live channel linked on the home page
[19:15] <siggiee> Italians are very 'appy bunch
[19:15] <cartoonairman> Italia Man is a precious cinnamon roll.
[19:15] <weer_dough> We need to get this man into a chat with Vinny.
[19:15] <icedhermit> Maybe running also makes noise? Or causes you to trip. Kinda a risk-reward situation.
[19:15] <sky8moon> you can heal yourself with a spray
[19:15] <papanade69> Rev protecc but also he attacc
[19:15] <johnrawrallday> Went into Volscente's chat and dropped some love and subbed <3
[19:15] <lightdasher> @RevScarecrow What would you say to an Alien game with this genres concept?
[19:15] <flametitan> I subbed to volscente, but I speak no italian.
[19:16] <thefocuswobbler> Yo Volscente gave me a shout out

[19:16] <carbonic0> we need to keep italian man spaghettis from being rustled
[19:16] <prob_rob> Can you jump out of the top story window
[19:16] <ryanviews> The rules are bit more clear in Dead By Daylight, I'll say that much.
[19:16] <trekkie313> @Cartoonairman IDK Vinny seems to be in constant agony Kappa
[19:16] <carbonic0> thats just vinny
[19:16] <will99222> I think closing doors might behind you might be a cool idea because then J-dog wont be able to follow you so obviously.
[19:16] <bechuga> nothing in wardrobes or just for hiding?
[19:16] <robrobrevolution> Nite everyone
[19:16] <somerandomsatanic> Night Rob ;3

[19:17] <carbonic0> what are we going to do if italian man is jason
[19:17] <thefocuswobbler> @JohnRawRallday Yah, he seems nice
[19:17] <icedhermit> Wjat's the point of hiding if Jason can see right through everything?
[19:17] <trekkie313> Cook pasta to appease him
[19:17] <papanade69> Rev, Did you make your character or is it a preset?
[19:17] <trekkie313> Its preset
[19:17] <thefocuswobbler> preset

[19:19] <squirrellilly> PLEASE HELP U-
[19:19] <sky8moon> it also slightly hurts you to do that lol
[19:19] <papanade69> This seems like a game that would only really be fun with a group of only friends
[19:19] <slipshodian> you'd think grouping up would be bad considering how easily he kills yall
[19:20] <will99222> @Trekkie313 MGS3? Jason can tell us how animals taste?
[19:20] <ryanviews> Oh, your face is scratched up.
[19:20] <weer_dough> Ow fuck that man's face.
[19:20] <carbonic0> i love how cut up his face looks, yet he hasnt lost any health
[19:20] <ryanviews> Maybe diving through windows is damaging you?

[19:20] <morings> LUL
[19:20] <trekkie313> @Will99222 Its a joke about 5th movie
[19:20] <flametitan> lol
[19:20] <luketriton> Spritz spritz
[19:20] <faldenvi> You wanna know how I got these scars!?... by having the best entrance ever, of course
[19:20] <zarkith> Who knew jumping through glass was a bad idea?
[19:20] <carbonic0> look at these normies opening the windows
[19:20] <buddyburkman> I haven't been following this game for a while, has it been a fully released yet?
[19:20] <trekkie313> THough Jason does eat wild animals
[19:20] <zephyreth> yeah jumping through glass in a realistic game isn't going to hurt you FailFish
[19:20] <slipshodian> it's the glass probably
[19:20] <shuuspillow> "spray me with disinfectant"
[19:20] <squirrellilly> *grope*
[19:21] <bechuga> in the water?
[19:21] <trekkie313> One guy, two girls

[19:21] <thefocuswobbler> ANTIFREEZE
[19:21] <somerandomsatanic> jerry can
[19:21] <carbonic0> jerald can
[19:21] <somerandomsatanic> he is trying ;3
[19:21] <lolzeroniandcheese> god i love the accents people have when playing this game
[19:21] <thestarryskye> why is it called a jerry can anyway
[19:21] <weer_dough> His fucking face every time he does a dive it's beautiful.
[19:21] <somerandomsatanic> Sky, not sure
[19:22] <bechuga> be careful with stamina rev
[19:22] <rmhgreen123> The run animation is kinda goofy
[19:22] <somerandomsatanic> maybe someone named Jerry wanted a can filled with gas?
[19:22] <thestarryskye> dude named jerry was like "what up this is my can"
[19:22] <carbonic0> someone explain why he's wearing jorts while wearing a long sleeve flannel with rolled up sleeves
[19:22] <skylerthemaster> 80s
[19:22] <carbonic0> ill accept that
[19:22] <shuuspillow> every time u crouch u look like a guilty gremlin
[19:22] <squirrellilly> I prefer ctrl
[19:22] <zarkith> Jerry was english slang for "Germans" in WW2, and they stole the design from them
[19:22] <johnrawrallday> frat boy yo
[19:22] <lpgdlf> so spoopy
[19:22] <zarkith> Thanks Wikiped
[19:22] <slipshodian> wasn't it called a jerry can because it was a german can and the brits called em jerries or something?
[19:23] <will99222> A Jerry can is called a Jerry can because they were invented by the Germans in WW1 or 2. The British Soldiers called the Germans "Jerries"
[19:23] <carbonic0> his mouth
[19:23] <thestarryskye> @Zarkith thanks dood
[19:23] <will99222> @Slipshodian nice
[19:23] <thestarryskye> and Will
[19:23] <lightdasher> RIP guy keeping Jason busy
[19:23] <outsiderxt> Actually it's from WW1 but yeah. The can was stolen by everyone because it's a hella good design.
[19:23] <thefocuswobbler> GAME THEORY: Why don't the camp counselor's age in Friday the 13th? Is it like a groundhog day?
[19:23] <lightdasher> oh I guess no RIP
[19:23] <outsiderxt> The name that is
[19:23] <ryanviews> Friday The 13th: Dive Highlight Reel™
[19:23] <outsiderxt> The can is ww2.
[19:23] <outsiderxt> i'M TIRED.
[19:23] <thestarryskye> s'okay
[19:23] <thestarryskye> revD
[19:23] <somerandomsatanic> gg
[19:23] <will99222> RIPREV
[19:23] <lightdasher> -boing-
[19:23] <lpgdlf> get spooped on son
[19:24] <theluigiguy> revD
[19:24] <shuuspillow> jason's a dick
[19:24] <will99222> r i v r e p
[19:24] <flametitan> The ragdoll jumped a little
[19:24] <stahlmagie> Teleporting literally on top of you seems a little OP.
[19:24] <coolcapybara> Whats that timer for?
[19:24] <ryanviews> Yeah, it just suddenly happens.
[19:24] <weer_dough> Yeah, the teleport thing seems kinda...eeeeh.
[19:24] <trekkie313> !uptime
[19:24] <moobot> Rev has been streaming for 1h 20m 34s
[19:24] <papanade69> That was fair Kappa
[19:24] <thefocuswobbler> What is Rev's player good for? Like mechanical, running, health?
[19:24] <rosutop> "Nothing personal kid"
[19:24] <prob_rob> Summer Car, yeah, babe?
[19:24] <stahlmagie> Like maybe if he teleported a little bit away.
[19:24] <thestarryskye> "jason wins" fucking SPOILERS
[19:24] <theadamantarchvile> Not in the Final Chapter, the 5th one
[19:24] <kodamann> @RevScarecrow it'd be more fun with friends
[19:24] <trekkie313> His mother was in the first movie
[19:24] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow but in the movies he also kicks a boombox, I Want boombox dlc
[19:24] <spotulip> So...how do the humans win in this? Can they kill Jason?
[19:24] <theadamantarchvile> Jason got killed by Corey Feldman in that one
[19:25] <slipshodian> i still say the teleport just needs a longer cooldown so he can't constantly keep warping to someone he isn't actively following
[19:25] <zephyreth> it's a horror movie, almost nobody lives by the end of one
[19:25] <dubemo> I think there needs to be a limit as to how close jason can appear to you
[19:25] <flametitan> Authentic movie =/= good gameplay
[19:25] <kengion> @RevScarecrow Best F13 character?
[19:25] <somerandomsatanic> its just a bad idea for a game
[19:25] <thefocuswobbler> @Trekkie313 Shhhh, spoilers
[19:25] <trekkie313> Lots of people survive in Jason Lives and Part 2
[19:25] <carbonic0> best ff13 character is sazh
[19:25] <boscojokey> jason wins FATALITY
[19:25] <papanade69> "pshh... Nothing personnel... Kid..." God I cant wait for this game to come out and people add a coldsteel mod
[19:25] <theluigiguy> this would be fun with the other streamers/friends
[19:25] <rmhgreen123> I just want jason x to be playable
[19:25] <carbonic0> laser beams
[19:25] <thefocuswobbler> But what about flannel?
[19:25] <prob_rob> Yep, that speed sure is... fast
[19:25] <thefocuswobbler> What's he good for?
[19:25] <spookyoogie> @RevScarecrow just wondering but will you at any point get new shirts in the store?
[19:26] <faldenvi> I'm rooting for Italian bro
[19:26] <slipshodian> where's the map where freddy is fighting jason for kills?
[19:26] <boscojokey> her hair has fizaxe
[19:26] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Flash games: Getting a Virus - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[19:26] <ryanviews> I wonder if any of the stats or perks would help with that teleport, but relying on RNG to win seems kinda...not good.
[19:26] <spotulip> Hope there's an option fro Jason in Space
[19:26] <papanade69> Plus she T H I C C
[19:26] <johnrawrallday> So we have Italian guy, Pre CAPS guy, and girl
[19:26] <cartoonairman> So flannel guy is the Mario of this game.
[19:27] <primalpolar> I'm watching you and one shot gurl stream this game.
[19:27] <bechuga> if it's so easy for Jason to kill people, why does he not seem to find anyone for ages?
[19:27] <skylerthemaster> its seems like the only way to stop the teleporting is to A. Keep moving or B. run in side a house and barricade it
[19:27] <ryanviews> Go Italian Dude!
[19:27] <boscojokey> RNJesus vs jason

[19:28] <slipshodian> you say that Rev, but some people are dumb enough to put oil in the gas tank and such
[19:28] <ryanviews> Put the funnel into the gas tank! Whoa!

[19:29] <carbonic0> netflix is apparently making a castlevania anime
[19:29] <xx_vinx_xx> VoteYea
[19:29] <thefocuswobbler> @Carbonic0 No way
[19:29] <outsiderxt> It's a bit repetitive.
[19:29] <ryanviews> I think this game has a ton of potential.
[19:29] <shuuspillow> loving goth girl's hairstyle
[19:29] <boscojokey> snipins a good job mate!
[19:29] <squirrellilly> Something AWESOME?
[19:29] <outsiderxt> Oh yeah, tons of potential.
[19:29] <spotulip> @Carbonic0 saw the trailer, looks pretty cool PogChamp
[19:30] <carbonic0> man how many good video game animes are there
[19:30] <studentcouncilpresident> none
[19:30] <papanade69> I feel like a good modding community could make this game good
[19:30] <lolzeroniandcheese> none
[19:30] <tyler81198> how reliant is sniper elite on having seen the other streams?
[19:30] <thefocuswobbler> @Carbonic0 King of the Hill
[19:30] <boscojokey> pokemon
[19:30] <carbonic0> does .hack count?
[19:30] <cartoonairman> Just one: Dai no Daibuken.
[19:30] <carbonic0> king of the hill is my favorite anime
[19:30] <spotulip> I hope the Castlevania anime doesn't suck
[19:30] <outsiderxt> Zillion is pretty fun.
[19:30] <shuuspillow> so is mario
[19:31] <tyler81198> so basic history, got it

[19:31] <zephyreth> the devs are listening to constructive criticism of the game so you can always just send your concerns to them and they will at least look at them
[19:31] <stahlmagie> World War 2 ends with an alien invasion, right? If not don't spoil me
[19:31] <boscojokey> an Australian who throws piss?
[19:31] <lightdasher> report back; "Jason OP"
[19:31] <carbonic0> its jar based karate
[19:31] <shuuspillow> yeah itll only help make their game better
[19:31] <ckqcy> pls nerf
[19:31] <theadamantarchvile> Chill on the jason
[19:32] <somerandomsatanic> its very unbalanced
[19:32] <stahlmagie> "I lose, nerf Jayson."
[19:32] <ryanviews> Devs seem pretty cool, at least. "Jason Teleport seems to have no real counterplay, especially with his special sight to see you regardless."
[19:32] <boscojokey> @revscarecrow tell them to add a jason nes skin
[19:32] <papanade69> Tell them to add a mod workshop so we can get Coldsteel in this shit
[19:32] <lightdasher> What about just a Ness skin
[19:32] <stahlmagie> Italia is still in it.
[19:32] <shuuspillow> unbalanced, jason is too op, teleporting seems a bit unfair
[19:32] <thefocuswobbler> Is he the only one?
[19:33] <fr3qi> I'm still a bit worried as this is the only map I have seen from this game. I know there will be others, buy I'm curious as to how the game will change on each map
[19:33] <ryanviews> Oh no, why is Italian Dude still here? He didn't escape?
[19:33] <faldenvi> Oh no, Italian bro, please make it out safely
[19:33] <carbonic0> wasnt there a movie about jason and the other guy from nightmare on elm street
[19:33] <weer_dough> It might help to have more hiding spaces packed tightly together. Right now hiding feels absolutely useless but if there were more hiding spaces to the point where Jason couldn't look everywhere, it could actually be useful.
[19:33] <zephyreth> there are 3 maps currently
[19:33] <tyler81198> @papanade69 pssh, nothin personel kid
[19:33] <squirrellilly> It's supposed to be unfair, right? Jason SHOULD have a big advantage.
[19:33] <icedhermit> Dude, not Volscente!
[19:33] <lightdasher> Allow teleportation, but give a limit to how close you can teleport to someone
[19:33] <zephyreth> and they are all unique
[19:33] <ryanviews> Yeah, it's supposed to be unfair, but then there's "having absolutely no chance".
[19:33] <ryanviews> The latter is the problem. :P
[19:34] <slipshodian> i feel like the jason right now is AFK
[19:34] <squirrellilly> I hear ya. I'm definitely going to give it a shot and see how it feels.
[19:34] <crimsonbinome> the RNG is the emphasis teamwork i think
[19:34] <moobot> If you like Rev's stuff subscribe to his youtube page https://www.youtube.com/user/RevScarecrow or if you missed something check out his full stream channel https://www.youtube.com/revscarecrowafterhours
[19:34] <crimsonbinome> a group needs one stun
[19:34] <crimsonbinome> 4 ppl seperated need one stun each
[19:34] <tyler81198> make it so jason has more trouble finding people and can be run from but if he gets you you are dead.
[19:34] <ryanviews> Italian Dude nooooo!
[19:34] <ryanviews> Get out man!
[19:34] <ckqcy> LOL
[19:34] <icedhermit> RUN, VOLSCENTE
[19:34] <faldenvi> Niice
[19:34] <thefocuswobbler> YEAH
[19:34] <stahlmagie> Nailed it.
[19:34] <carbonic0> GO ITALIAN MAN
[19:34] <somerandomsatanic> Nice
[19:34] <ryanviews> Yeahhhhh!
[19:34] <faldenvi> Yay, Italy bro
[19:34] <fantasmatic2> i just got in, did this lady just fucking murder jason?
[19:34] <lightdasher> !FUKQ"
[19:34] <ilasja> YAY
[19:34] <somerandomsatanic> gg
[19:34] <icedhermit> YEAAAAH
[19:34] <fantasmatic2> what is this game even?
[19:34] <dondoran85> wow Volscente, nice
[19:35] <sprode> The Italian Stallion
[19:35] <faldenvi> Tell Italy bro he did a great job
[19:35] <zarkith> One hit with a basebal bat in his chest knocks him out cold? He's a fucking supermonster
[19:35] <papanade69> Yay, Italian dude mad it!
[19:35] <thefocuswobbler> @Fantasmatic2 Friday the 13th the game, and Jason can't die, he has a 1.7% chance to die though
[19:35] <fantasmatic2> @thefocuswobbler huh, so what did she do? just stun him?
[19:35] <fantasmatic2> and what do you mean of 1.7% chance of dying, like after getting hit or?
[19:35] <thefocuswobbler> @Fantasmatic2 Don't quote me on the 1.7% chance though. Yeah she did stun him though
[19:35] <thestarryskye> @RevScarecrow Jason can take a gunshot to the face and not be phased
[19:36] <fantasmatic2> aight thanks SeemsGood
[19:36] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[19:36] <papanade69> That sounds like a hilarious bug
[19:36] <fantasmatic2> oh wait did i just come at the end of the stream?
[19:36] <prob_rob> Will it be on Steam as a Kickstarter?
[19:36] <thefocuswobbler> @Fantasmatic2 You have a 1.7% chance to kill Jason
[19:36] <fantasmatic2> NotLikeThis
[19:36] <thefocuswobbler> No, he is going to do sniper eilite
[19:36] <fantasmatic2> oh 4Head
[19:36] <ryanviews> That just shows more balance issues.
[19:36] <flametitan> @Fantasmatic2 We're going on break and then going on Nutshot Elite
[19:36] <thefocuswobbler> BloodTrail You good man
[19:36] <ryanviews> "you're not invisible unless you're her."

[19:36] <fantasmatic2> BATHROOM BREAK WutFace
[19:37] <somerandomsatanic> BegWan
[19:37] <zephyreth> from what i heard there might be ways actually kill Jason and it's tied with how each Jason actually died in the movies
[19:37] <thestarryskye> @Prob_Rob do you mean greenlight? I think it's already on steam
[19:37] <zephyreth> or "died" since he never really stays dead
[19:37] <fantasmatic2> @Zephyreth so sending him to outer space is also a way to kill him?
[19:37] <prob_rob> Nah man, completely as a Kickstarter
[19:37] <natalietoday> !uptime
[19:37] <moobot> Rev has been streaming for 1h 33m 53s

[19:37] <natalietoday> hey @RevScarecrow, hey chat! <3
[19:37] <papanade69> Do we ever learn what Jason is in any of the movies?
[19:37] <prob_rob> like, there's too many alphas, betas, Early Access, what about a Kickstarter version
[19:37] <faldenvi> Hiya natalie
[19:37] <natalietoday> hey random, starry, shuu
[19:38] <carbonic0> hello natalie

[19:38] <fantasmatic2> @papanade69 wasn't he like a drowned child?
[19:38] <natalietoday> hey falden, carbonic
[19:38] <prob_rob> Dude, think about it
[19:38] <thefocuswobbler> @Zephyreth That would be an interesting concept, like the necronomicon
[19:38] <prob_rob> it'd be so unique
[19:38] <prob_rob> and annoying
[19:38] <prob_rob> actually, fuck that idea
[19:38] <boscojokey> jason op pls nerf
[19:38] <zephyreth> @Fantasmatic2 if the jason that died from that is in the game then possibly... no idea how each jason died since i don't watch the movies
[19:38] <prob_rob> fuck me
[19:38] <thestarryskye> @papanade69 first one, yes. all the rest he's just a zombie
[19:38] <fantasmatic2> btw does anybody remember that movie with jason in a spaceship?
[19:38] <thefocuswobbler> Jason X
[19:38] <natalietoday> oh man did i get here at the end?
[19:38] <thestarryskye> Jason X

[19:38] <thestarryskye> @natalietoday we shooting nazis next
[19:38] <fantasmatic2> @Zephyreth i think that's how they killed him in Jason X @thefocuswobbler that's the one

[19:39] <icedhermit> OSsloth
[19:39] <somerandomsatanic> Sub HYPE
[19:39] <genericredsquar3> KappaPride KappaPride
[19:39] <theluigiguy> oh shit Gopter shirt
[19:39] <tyler81198> some games are good for early access, generally games that have "infinite replayability" (roguelikes, sandboxes, and competitive MP games) are really good for EA
[19:39] <morings> burst the bratwurst
[19:39] <deluxer21> oh really
[19:39] <zephyreth> you can also find his little hut somewhere in the map that gives you a one time use item that instantly stuns jason even after he grabs you
[19:39] <somerandomsatanic> LUL
[19:39] <fantasmatic2> @Morings that's a surprisingly good joke PogChamp
[19:39] <thetoxicavenger666> @Morings rev5
[19:39] <revscarecrow> gonna go offline and back
[19:39] <natalietoday> oh shit if he weren't going BRB right now i'd use the daddy emotes Kappa

[19:39] <fantasmatic2> "im gonna go o-"
[19:39] <thefocuswobbler> @Fantasmatic2 I thought they launched him him in space? Think you are thinking of Jason Goes To hell for the Necronomicon
[19:39] <thestarryskye> hopefully I can be one of the 9 soon, gotta get some bills paid first BegWan
[19:39] <natalietoday> @Fantasmatic2 same lmao
[19:40] <fantasmatic2> @thefocuswobbler never said anything about necronomicons?

[19:47] <theluigiguy> hi Boostarpictures
[19:47] <actuallysortahere> I'm normally quietly sitting in the corner but twitch kept shouting at me with twitch prime
[19:47] <fantasmatic2> this sort of looks like one of those "easy 4 steps drawing tutorial", draw the outlines first get some of the details in add color and you're done
[19:47] <carbonic0> dorfman, more like dorkman
[19:47] <somerandomsatanic> hello @Boostarpictures
[19:48] <boscojokey> @revscarecrow is jarate in this game?
[19:48] <natalietoday> leftenant
[19:48] <boostarpictures> @boscojokey I was literally just thinking that! :p hahaha!
[19:48] <elephantboyq> It's a dlc weapon Kappa
[19:48] <somerandomsatanic> me too
[19:48] <actuallysortahere> He looks like a thin man.
[19:49] <flametitan> @natalietoday It's how non americans pronounce it. I know; I'm Canadian and we use both pronunciations
[19:49] <dragontamer111> https://clips.twitch.tv/EnticingConsiderateGorillaDxCat/edit
[19:49] <natalietoday> @flametitan i'm honorary Canadian (i'm from Michigan) so i've heard both in regular conversation as well lol
[19:49] <theluigiguy> oh it looks like Clips are whitelisted
[19:49] <fantasmatic2> señor de las leyes?
[19:49] <flametitan> @natalietoday cool :)
[19:49] <atleast3dolphins> Hello peeple
[19:49] <theluigiguy> hi Dolphins
[19:49] <ryanviews> Corn Dogs are fantastic.

[19:49] <somerandomsatanic> corn dogs are good <3
[19:49] <natalietoday> hey dolphins!
[19:49] <thetoxicavenger666> Corndogs are great
[19:49] <somerandomsatanic> Hello @atleast3Dolphins
[19:49] <elephantboyq> Is that a dog made out of corn?
[19:49] <fantasmatic2> the lord of the rules? that's sort of badass title for a judge
[19:50] <boscojokey> so is this a game where you preform assassinations with a sniper rifle?
[19:50] <atleast3dolphins> Corndogs taste best when eaten on stream
[19:50] <natalietoday> [LAUGHS]
[19:50] <boostarpictures> Never had a corn dog, what does it taste like?
[19:50] <shuuspillow> theyre alright, the bun they use is sometimes too sweet
[19:50] <morings> i once dropped a corn dog into a cup of soda and the breading got mushy and started to slough off and i've never been able to stomach them since
[19:50] <fantasmatic2> @RevScarecrow i think he said señor de las leyes at first 4Head
[19:50] <ryanviews> If hot dogs are a sandwich...what are corn dogs?
[19:50] <morings> popsicle
[19:50] <fantasmatic2> they're milk
[19:50] <natalietoday> Karl~

[19:51] <zarkith> The only characters in this game worth caring about are the nazi's exploding balls
[19:51] <somerandomsatanic> i can't escape it
[19:51] <fantasmatic2> i've been eating ice cream and i don't know if it's a cream or if its an ice
[19:51] <deluxer21> is that a jojo reference
[19:51] <elephantboyq> What about racing Nazis?
[19:51] <ryanviews> It...kinda makes sense, actually!
[19:51] <thefocuswobbler> Jeez, that bass on the dudes voice
[19:51] <fantasmatic2> does it resemble a frozen soup perhaps?
[19:51] <fantasmatic2> is ice cream a soup? who cares!
[19:51] <elephantboyq> I expected him to just jump into the ocean tbh.
[19:51] <boostarpictures> I forgot it's like 1am here I shouldn't even be awake :D ah well! I'm staying riiight here!
[19:52] <fantasmatic2> i mean im guessing all those guns would be sort of heavy to climb a rock wall yeah?
[19:52] <elephantboyq> If it were botw, you could climb rock walls. Kappa
[19:52] <fantasmatic2> in botw you can climb anything, link's got some muscles

[19:53] <zarkith> HOW THE FUCK!?

[19:55] <zarkith> Is it actually confirmed real? I thought it was just an unconfirmed leak at this point
[19:55] <morings> why did they think this was a good idea
[19:55] <deluxer21> DICKSHOT
[19:55] <natalietoday> oh my god @Morings you hadn't seen it until just now? it's horrific
[19:55] <elephantboyq> That was way too high up.
[19:55] <somerandomsatanic> everyone i know has been tweeting about it
[19:55] <natalietoday> SO close
[19:55] <weer_dough> It's real. It terrifies me by existing.
[19:55] <atleast3dolphins> Was that last nutshot the first of this stream?
[19:55] <fantasmatic2> @Prob_Rob that pun is too advanced for me

[19:56] <deluxer21> TESTIKILL LUL
[19:56] <zarkith> It's a TACTICS game!?!?
[19:56] <ryanviews> That hit just about everything but the balls.
[19:57] <fantasmatic2> that sort of sounds like a badass way to kill someone using tesla coils, instead it's a nutshot
[19:57] <theluigiguy> It's supposedly a strategy RPG
[19:57] <boostarpictures> Is it just me enjoying this a lot coz I usually play as Sniper in TF2?? ;p lol
[19:57] <elephantboyq> right through the
[19:57] <fantasmatic2> eh i've had worse
[19:57] <ryanviews> Testakill sounds like a badass metal album.
[19:57] <ryanviews> I'm down with it.
[19:57] <somerandomsatanic> https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessLazyDotterelNomNom
[19:57] <elephantboyq> boom
[19:57] <zarkith> That's even worse
[19:57] <xing1870> tf2 snipers are the scum of the earth
[19:57] <bortonium> a gun
[19:57] <elephantboyq> RPG?
[19:57] <natalietoday> revD
[19:57] <ryanviews> That's such a precise artillery shot.
[19:58] <atleast3dolphins> How did they kill you? Your nuts were behind cover
[19:58] <carbonic0> tf2 sniping is bullcrap because the hit box is so large for the shot
[19:58] <fantasmatic2> the sound of heavy footsteps? clearly a secret nazi radio mecha
[19:58] <spadekingdom> is it just me or is game mega quiet?
[19:58] <ryanviews> Game audio is fine for me.
[19:58] <morings> it's fine for me
[19:58] <spadekingdom> hmmm maybe its me then thanks
[19:58] <somerandomsatanic> game audio is fine for me
[19:58] <boostarpictures> Ah yeah TF2 hit boxes are messed up :p gotta agree with that
[19:58] <fantasmatic2> @RevScarecrow it's the giant mecha secret radio nazi
[19:58] <thefocuswobbler> The nazis
[19:58] <carbonic0> TF2 is still pretty fun though
[19:58] <atleast3dolphins> Nutshot the tank!
[19:58] <elephantboyq> Yet I still can't hit anything in TF2
[19:58] <carbonic0> albeit not aging very well
[19:58] <spookyoogie> @RevScarecrow Artillary maybe?
[19:58] <zarkith> You explode their balls, they explode your hideyhole
[19:58] <ryanviews> Nazis don't care about shelling their own buildings!
[19:59] <zarkith> Tit for tat
[19:59] <icythelucario> https://clips.twitch.tv/ClumsyWildTireKappaWealth/edit
[19:59] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 with the huntsman it is a massive target, using the sniper rifle it has more to do with the dude's ping
[19:59] <carbonic0> yeah
[19:59] <carbonic0> snapping is your friend with sniper rifle
[19:59] <boostarpictures> Ah yeah I use the Huntsman and Jarate. It's ridiculously overpowered
[19:59] <boscojokey> if you were fighting girls would you go for vag shots?
[20:00] <carbonic0> nah, supposively getting hit in the boob hurts more
[20:00] <fantasmatic2> @Boostarpictures i mean, it just takes one person that knows how to play to kill you, ain't that hard to avoid an arrow
[20:00] <elephantboyq> probably ovaries.
[20:00] <carbonic0> its jar based karate rev
[20:00] <fantasmatic2> a piss jar
[20:00] <fantasmatic2> defend this at all costs, by throwing grenades to it
[20:00] <morings> now he doesnt because he's dead! :D
[20:01] <boscojokey> how old is this game?
[20:01] <carbonic0> it just came out this year i believe
[20:01] <carbonic0> like a month ago
[20:01] <elephantboyq> "Defend the fireworks factory with mortar shells!"
[20:01] <fantasmatic2> was it really just a month ago?

[20:01] <elephantboyq> It's like, 2 or 3 months iirc. I'm bad at time though.
[20:02] <fantasmatic2> exits* block their existance too though i guess

[20:02] <cosmo0busrebirth> @RevScarecrow Am I still welcome here?
[20:02] <boscojokey> does this game end with you killing hitler?
[20:02] <boostarpictures> Ah I usually play TF2 and Overwatch. :p but I enjoy tactical games too
[20:02] <fantasmatic2> i mean i gotta say i care more about tf2 than overwatch, for 2-3 reasons
[20:02] <ryanviews> "Stealth."
[20:02] <fantasmatic2> i can't run it on this computer, and tf2 is free
[20:02] <carbonic0> i really like tactical stealth games
[20:03] <erlandehilaire> cheer25 🍆🔫
[20:03] <somerandomsatanic> BYPE
[20:03] <dutchyargo> i dont think "why" is the right question "how" would be better
[20:03] <carbonic0> tactical multiplayer stealth games
[20:03] <theluigiguy> BYPE
[20:03] <morings> bype!
[20:03] <elephantboyq> I like games.
[20:03] <fantasmatic2> also replayability, instead of having a different hero for every type of weapon they have multiple weapons for every type of character
[20:03] <tyler81198> @ryanviews mgs in a nutshell right there
[20:03] <ryanviews> This is how I played MGS3, at least. :P
[20:03] <erlandehilaire> eh, you tried :)
[20:03] <ryanviews> You gonna give me a machine gun, by golly I'm gonna use it.
[20:03] <boostarpictures> @fantasmatic2 ah yeah but the weapons is why I'm not so keen on TF2. It's all based on weapons, not real total skill
[20:03] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Boostarpictures I dont know why I dont like OW, but I have over 400 hours in tf2
[20:03] <boscojokey> overwatch is a sub-par tf2 ripoff
[20:03] <carbonic0> i prefer tf2 to overwatch
[20:04] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow when will emotes be approved?
[20:04] <waypastfuture> ths sorrow must've been fun for you, ryan
[20:04] <carbonic0> but overwatch is better made and better balanced
[20:04] <dubemo> such a lust for NUTS
[20:04] <fantasmatic2> @Boostarpictures not sure why you think that?, every single weapon requires its own different skills (well excluding those that are basically the same)
[20:04] <carbonic0> mostly cause they have more then 5 people working on the game
[20:04] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Carbonic0 How dare you
[20:04] <fantasmatic2> @Boostarpictures i guess you do have to play for a while to get weapon drops and i get that
[20:04] <toasterquestion> Hello
[20:04] <cosmo0busrebirth> I like my reserve shooter the way it is
[20:04] <toasterquestion> Kappa
[20:04] <elephantboyq> I prefer game.
[20:04] <carbonic0> overwatch is not a rip off of tf2 though lol
[20:04] <weer_dough> Don't let your dreams be dreams. Put that bullet in someone's dick. You can do it!
[20:04] <dutchyargo> hear that rev? u need more bullets
[20:04] <fantasmatic2> yeah its a paladin's rip off @Carbonic0
[20:04] <weer_dough> Oh...or not.
[20:04] <uncle_wizard> the dream is dead.
[20:04] <elephantboyq> I play both games regularly.
[20:05] <carbonic0> they have similarities dont get me wrong, but how the games play out is completely different
[20:05] <boostarpictures> @fantasmatic2 ah yeah I don't have a lot of good items tbh
[20:05] <cosmo0busrebirth> Oh, can anyone hear me or read my messages?
[20:05] <natalietoday> SUB HYPE
[20:05] <somerandomsatanic> SUB
[20:05] <erint21> 2 bullets one guy, squeal to two girls one cup
[20:05] <carbonic0> overwatch is way more organized and less about being crazy and getting kills for your frag montage like tf2 is
[20:05] <lpgdlf> stealth
[20:05] <theluigiguy> SUB HYPE rev5
[20:05] <dutchyargo> i love how realistically unrealistic bullet sway is
[20:05] <cosmo0busrebirth> @theluigiguy IS MY MESSAGES GOING THREW?
[20:05] <theluigiguy> yes
[20:05] <cosmo0busrebirth> ok
[20:05] <boostarpictures> @carbonic0 I agree. I usually play Overwatch when I'm being casual, TF2 when I'm hardcore
[20:05] <zarkith> So does anyone know what the point of all those metal stars on the wall is?
[20:06] <theluigiguy> sorry I was AFK for a bit
[20:06] <carbonic0> tf2 is actually pretty hard at times lol
[20:06] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 most of what i've seen on overwatch is basically the same unorganized mess though?
[20:06] <boscojokey> @revscarecrow screw these guys! go kill hitler!
[20:06] <cosmo0busrebirth> Its fiine
[20:06] <elephantboyq> Stone the Nazis to death. It'll take a while, but you have infinite rocks.
[20:06] <toasterquestion> revOlaf I can use This now revOlaf
[20:06] <dubemo> @carbonic0 yes organized as in less freedom to fuck around
[20:06] <lpgdlf> let people know that the wall is a good boy
[20:06] <natalietoday> RESUB HYPE
[20:06] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[20:06] <somerandomsatanic> RESUB ;3
[20:06] <theluigiguy> 1/2 YEAR RESUB rev5
[20:06] <fantasmatic2> hey sub bype
[20:06] <carbonic0> Overwatch is built as a competitive game, tf2 is built as a screw around game lol
[20:06] <boostarpictures> @carbonic0 yeah totally. It can be a bit annoying :p
[20:06] <zarkith> Doesn't look very reinforcing to me
[20:06] <toasterquestion> Resub Hype rev5
[20:06] <carbonic0> tf2 was never meant for competitive
[20:07] <fantasmatic2> you're a real silver dude today!
[20:07] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Carbonic0 Yes, and?
[20:07] <carbonic0> overwatch your still encouraged to work together
[20:07] <cosmo0busrebirth> Yes and?
[20:07] <dubemo> esports LUL
[20:07] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 again not sure about that, never seen anybody in overwatch try team work?
[20:07] <fantasmatic2> no more than you would see in tf2 anyways
[20:07] <carbonic0> i have
[20:07] <carbonic0> i have plenty of times lol
[20:07] <elephantboyq> They are both pretty good games.
[20:07] <boostarpictures> @fantasmatic2 I've seen a lot of teamwork :)
[20:07] <carbonic0> exactly
[20:07] <carbonic0> ive played 200+ hours in both games
[20:07] <cosmo0busrebirth> And you haven't seen teamwork in TF2?
[20:08] <carbonic0> ive seen teamwork in tf2 but its much rarer
[20:08] <carbonic0> and usually its just one team roflstomping another
[20:08] <cosmo0busrebirth> rarer?
[20:08] <thefocuswobbler> @Fantasmatic2 I've overwatched with team work, but it's almost hard to find. Same with TF2, there is team work
[20:08] <ryanviews> The best thing to say to your team in CS:GO: "He's somewhere."
[20:08] <toasterquestion> LOL
[20:08] <somerandomsatanic> LUL
[20:08] <cosmo0busrebirth> Are you actually playing the game
[20:08] <boostarpictures> I agree. You can find teamwork, but it's tricky
[20:08] <fantasmatic2> well i guess it depends on the countries but teamwork's pretty common where im from @Carbonic0
[20:08] <cosmo0busrebirth> have you ever played CTF?
[20:08] <elephantboyq> I see teamwork in tf2 all the time, but it's just a lot less organized and more chaotic.
[20:08] <elephantboyq> and it's accidental most of the time
[20:08] <fantasmatic2> well, not pretty common, at least more than i've seen in overwatch
[20:08] <carbonic0> i dont play ctf because i get punished for leaving when the games take too long and ill get a penalty if i leave
[20:08] <ryanviews> What did he do to sabotage that?
[20:08] <ryanviews> He just danced right next to it!
[20:09] <natalietoday> doo-doo-DOOOO
[20:09] <carbonic0> i said the same thing twice i have good memory
[20:09] <boscojokey> TAAAAAANK
[20:09] <ryanviews> Maybe those computers couldn't comprehend human emotion.
[20:09] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 unless you play competitive there's no penalty though, and yeah ctf is one of the worst gamemodes in tf2
[20:09] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Elephantboyq The army growing around the heavy storming the other team in Turbine
[20:09] <boostarpictures> Overwatch is more "I'll go tank you go healer" and TF2 is more "Pyro set everyone on fire coz Medic said 'spy'"
[20:09] <carbonic0> there is a penalty for t f2 lol
[20:09] <carbonic0> casual anyway
[20:09] <fantasmatic2> no time limits tend to lead to stalemates
[20:09] <carbonic0> as far as i knew anyway
[20:09] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 casual doesn't have any penalties, and nobody plays competitive
[20:09] <carbonic0> cause tf2 isnt a competitive game
[20:09] <thefocuswobbler> @Boostarpictures in a nutshell BloodTrail
[20:09] <cosmo0busrebirth> YES
[20:09] <toasterquestion> Yee
[20:09] <veraxis1> they couln't handle his sweet dance moved @ryanviews
[20:10] <carbonic0> overwatch gets super fun at competitive levels if you play it like that
[20:10] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Carbonic0 Whats wrong with a game made for fun?
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 because nobody plays competitive, you need at least 12 people for the server to start and nobody does because there's nobody doing it
[20:10] <elephantboyq> Use your shotgun and snipe the tank.
[20:10] <carbonic0> im not saying its bad, im just saying its not as well made
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> it's a loop
[20:10] <cserbapeti> Its always a option to nut ?
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> it's a decade old game carbonic
[20:10] <carbonic0> it is
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> it's olding surprisingly well
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> holding*
[20:10] <ryanviews> No one in this world can give clear instructions, Nazi or not. :P
[20:10] <boostarpictures> TF2 is good for modders and chaotic people, Overwatch is good for competitive people :)
[20:10] <toasterquestion> Tunnel Snakes Rule Kappa
[20:10] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Carbonic0 When you dont make your own engine for a game, its not going to be as well made.
[20:10] <fantasmatic2> despite the fact that there's like 3-5 guys working on it at all nowadays
[20:10] <morings> I gotta head out, family emergency. See ya later ya'll. Thanks for the stream rev
[20:10] <elephantboyq> Panzerfaust!? PogChamp
[20:10] <ryanviews> Take care!
[20:11] <natalietoday> take care morings <3
[20:11] <boostarpictures> Honestly I just like any game with good gameplay and cool characters :p
[20:11] <carbonic0> im just saying there are bugs decades old that still havent been fixed in tf2
[20:11] <dutchyargo> its called apanzerfaust rev omg
[20:11] <toasterquestion> @Morings Hope Things are ok See you later
[20:11] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Boostarpictures So you like tf2 more then overwatch
[20:11] <somerandomsatanic> bye @Morings
[20:11] <carbonic0> not gonna lie tf2 has cooler characters then overwatch in my opinion
[20:11] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Flash games: Getting a Virus - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[20:11] <carbonic0> the comics are great
[20:11] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 nothing game breaking, and again there's like 5 dudes top working on tf2 anymore, valve just doesn't see it anymore
[20:11] <dutchyargo> a panzerfaust. no thats why im helping
[20:11] <thefocuswobbler> Jes'
[20:11] <theluigiguy> bye Morings best wishes
[20:11] <carbonic0> yeah i know
[20:11] <toasterquestion> I'm a Pyro?
[20:11] <somerandomsatanic> kinda
[20:11] <boostarpictures> @cosmo0busrebirth idk I like them both equally
[20:12] <carbonic0> im not saying tf2 is bad, im just saying overwatch is better made
[20:12] <carbonic0> even though i find tf2 more fun
[20:12] <nik12787> Panzerfaust means "bazooka" in German
[20:12] <dutchyargo> assholes are definitely in the know
[20:12] <boostarpictures> Holy crud the TF2 comics did make me cry when Sniper died I'll be honest
[20:12] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Fantasmatic2 I think if TF2 went a year without an update, no one would leave it
[20:12] <flametitan> I'd say Rev knows a bit more about what's going on in this game, as I'm busy doing other things
[20:12] <waypastfuture> "I dont know shit" -socrated
[20:12] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow i actively avoid learning so i can know absolutely nothing for as long as possible MiniK
[20:12] <cosmo0busrebirth> The fanbase is a base
[20:12] <cosmo0busrebirth> its there
[20:12] <dutchyargo> it literally means armor fost
[20:12] <zarkith> And then when you do learn things, you make a conscious effort to forget them? @RevScarecrow
[20:12] <fantasmatic2> @cosmo0busREBIRTH it's basically gone through that cosmo
[20:12] <dutchyargo> armor fist
[20:12] <boostarpictures> But I love the deep backstory of Overwatch :p
[20:12] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Fantasmatic2 50k people play it a day
[20:13] <fantasmatic2> @cosmo0busREBIRTH im not disagreeing with you, im agreeing with you it's basically gone a year with nothing but hat updates and there's still people playing it
[20:13] <dutchyargo> you did it
[20:13] <carbonic0> i honestly dont like overwatches characters due to the way the fanbase reacts with them
[20:13] <carbonic0> they arent as deep as thought out as some of the tf2 characters though
[20:13] <fantasmatic2> "this dangerous australian psychopat is an adorable uguu who wants to date his pig pal"
[20:14] <fantasmatic2> is that what you mean by fanbase reaction?
[20:14] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Fantasmatic2 What im saying, is that. If you just left it, and worked on an big update for a year. It would still have a big fanbase
[20:14] <toasterquestion> So this what happens when people go into a Gay Jail in Discord Rev and other streams Shoot them in this game and shoot them in the jail. @RevScarecrow
[20:14] <moobot> Wanna have your fan art shown on stream? Post it here http://vinesauce.booru.org/ and Rev will show it at the end of the stream. Make sure to put "rev" tag so he can find it.
[20:14] <carbonic0> and OHH PHARMERCY GET IT CAUSE THEY WORK OUT
[20:14] <dutchyargo> the biggest danger to intelligence are moles. you can have 10,000 guys spying on the enemy, if the enemy has 1 guy on your side, all those 10,000 are fucked.
[20:14] <boostarpictures> I agree the fanbase can be weird
[20:14] <fantasmatic2> btw what the hell is rev even talking about? i got lost in tf2/overwatch discussion
[20:14] <carbonic0> JOEL ARE YOU KILLING JEWS AGAIN? JOEL!?
[20:14] <boscojokey> tf2 vs overwatch is the new mario vs sonic
[20:15] <cosmo0busrebirth> @Fantasmatic2 ME_IRL
[20:15] <nick2424delcat> me "Hi daddy rev" @RevScarecrow "OH YOU!!!"
[20:15] <boostarpictures> @fantasmatic2 holy crud ye I got so lost in this
[20:15] <lordwisp> I still love that one mission you did Rev. "Our men are dying of the sickness, finds the medicine."... find medicine, they bomb it out of exsistance.
[20:15] <chemtrailskillus> my friend got this game he said it's fun. looks good
[20:15] <elephantboyq> Rev's just ranting about an obvious traitor
[20:15] <chemtrailskillus> oh that's where the bullet meme is from
[20:15] <dubemo> but revs...the jews probably took a few extra sheckles from him! eez justified
[20:15] <carbonic0> i want a 2 player co op game where one person is a ground guy and the other is a sniper and they help eachother out
[20:15] <startrek2221> damn it you blew your cover
[20:15] <thefocuswobbler> @RevScarecrow you think?
[20:15] <deluxer21> @Carbonic0 I mean you can do that in this game
[20:16] <carbonic0> what
[20:16] <ryanviews> Only took a couple explosions and blatant murder, but only now has the cover been blown!
[20:16] <startrek2221> Ooo, right in the jugular
[20:16] <carbonic0> i need to buy this
[20:16] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 there's a game where one dude is a sniper and he's trying to kill the ground spy dude
[20:16] <lw97> isn't this wallhack technically
[20:16] <dutchyargo> why u no co-op!?
[20:16] <boostarpictures> If it was co-op could the other person be a Medic because the Snipers never get healed
[20:16] <nik12787> And there goes the helmet
[20:16] <natalietoday> hats off to you
[20:16] <ryanviews> Those helmets don't seem to be doing much good...
[20:16] <dawnyan> "The eyes are like the balls of the face" Thats a good song lyric

[20:19] <fantasmatic2> i feel like an ass fetish is far too common?
[20:19] <prob_rob> If cum is sex pee, what's pre-cum?
[20:19] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:19] <natalietoday> rev...

[20:19] <somerandomsatanic> no
[20:19] <ryanviews> I dunno what you can do with elbows, though...
[20:19] <boostarpictures> I feel like we should all write a fanfic. We all know too much about naughty things.
[20:19] <dawnyan> are we talking about tickle spots limesHmm
[20:19] <uncle_wizard> Rev rule 10 mate.
[20:19] <dawnyan> Kappa

[20:20] <chemtrailskillus> eyeball licking is a thing
[20:20] <ryanviews> I mean, aren't people sometimes crazy about anime eyes?
[20:20] <theluigiguy> Can any eyeball fetishist in chat confirm
[20:20] <signalerror> Rev, there is a hole. You are in it, and you have a shovel. Your move
[20:20] <dubemo> ever seen eye fucking?
[20:20] <fantasmatic2> @RevScarecrow that's exactly what someone who's into eyes and elbows would say!
[20:20] <xion_xii> what kind of ape arms do you have@revscarecrow
[20:20] <dutchyargo> everything is my fetish
[20:20] <thefocuswobbler> there is some manga where a girl licks another girls eye and tries to scoop it

[20:24] <toasterquestion> Does Vinny have Bee Fetish?
[20:24] <carbonic0> vinny is an italian bee
[20:24] <boscojokey> well deviantart exsist so yeah

[20:24] <beiman86> this is the kind of shit statistics is used for, you dont know the number, nor can you, but you make a guess using some other numbers and hope its a good estimate

[20:26] <carbonic0> man, ive found that furrys and neonazis are related most of the time
[20:26] <beiman86> I think thats what schools with strict dress codes are trying to supress. weird collarbone and knee and other weird body part fetishes
[20:26] <whoguru5> would you suck rev chat?
[20:26] <natalietoday> is the dick sucking exclusively reserved for Nazis though
[20:26] <startrek2221> Guys, I have a problem. I need reddit karma, but I'm shy and have no original content to offer. What should I do?
[20:26] <chemtrailskillus> collarbones are a good fetish

[20:26] <drcoxn183> are you talking about the neonazi ways of homopobia ?
[20:26] <somerandomsatanic> NotLikeThis
[20:26] <somerandomsatanic> Yes
[20:27] <ryanviews> Going further, what does "fuck you" even mean?
[20:27] <toasterquestion> Nazis's are pieces of trash on this earth so ISIS trash
[20:27] <beiman86> if i had so much dick that i could fuck myself, i would be proud
[20:27] <lordwisp> Rev have you noticed, people like to skirt the rules of what is ok to put on Wikipedia, when you just go to look up a small bug and see disgusting shit. But it's "Medical" Troll face
[20:27] <tyler81198> those of you that have the daddy emote now is the time to use it
[20:27] <zarkith> It's more "stick your dick in your own ass" than it is "masturbation"
[20:27] <thefocuswobbler> Porn exist because you like the boobies
[20:27] <dutchyargo> it's an insult aimed at hermaphrodites dating back to ancient indian times where idk
[20:27] <carbonic0> this is going to be on after hours and everyone is going to be like "what!?"
[20:27] <drcoxn183> nazi and isis is basically the same thing
[20:27] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:27] <dawnyan> hmm
[20:27] <somerandomsatanic> pls no
[20:27] <carbonic0> i heard people are flexible enough to suck their own bits

[20:27] <uncle_wizard> It was eyeballs rev
[20:27] <beiman86> well there are dudes that suck their own dick so..... i dont see it out of the question
[20:27] <carbonic0> i heard its not very fufilling though
[20:27] <prob_rob> Is there porn of fingernails?
[20:27] <dutchyargo> if u remove the lower 2 ribs ur supposed to be able to
[20:27] <drcoxn183> id suck my own dick if i could
[20:28] <weer_dough> I watched a car reviewer try to suck his own dick once. I can agree after watching it that it is, indeed, hard to pull off.
[20:28] <dutchyargo> u also gotta be black!
[20:28] <carbonic0> you have the internet @Prob_Rob
[20:28] <prob_rob> Whoa
[20:28] <dawnyan> how did we get here
[20:28] <thefocuswobbler> @RevScarecrow Like sucking your own dick, but with your ass? Rev please, explain
[20:28] <theluigiguy> Is this conversation all because we're trying to shoot Nazi balls
[20:28] <prob_rob> I'm intrigued
[20:28] <natalietoday> yes lugi
[20:28] <zarkith> Yes
[20:28] <elephantboyq> Remove a rib or two, then one can suck their own dick.
[20:28] <somerandomsatanic> @theluigiguy yes
[20:28] <zarkith> We got here from eye balls
[20:28] <carbonic0> we just need one of them sex robots they are working on
[20:28] <zarkith> And it wasn't even an eye shot, it was a brain shot
[20:28] <toasterquestion> Rule 34 There is imagnal porn everywhere on internet
[20:28] <beiman86> or go to a yoga class several years
[20:28] <prob_rob> Carbonic!
[20:28] <boostarpictures> I had to go away for a few moments and I come back to this.
[20:28] <prob_rob> There is!
[20:28] <tyler81198> @theluigiguy yep
[20:29] <carbonic0> wait is that actually rule 34? i thought it was "if its on the internet, there is porn of it"
[20:29] <dutchyargo> if there's no porn of it: you're in china
[20:29] <dubemo> btw, why do the nazis get so much shit? sure they did a buncha horrible shit but what about stalin? At least hitler didn't massacre his own people....genghis mother fucking khan doe

[20:29] <beiman86> ghengis khan was a pimp
[20:29] <zarkith> There are centipedes in your pillow
[20:29] <ryanviews> If someone came to my house and dumped spiders in my house, I'd punch them in the face. :(
[20:29] <somerandomsatanic> Nick, pls no
[20:29] <beiman86> he got around a bit
[20:29] <carbonic0> i heard if you release a bee into the bed room is makes it more sexy
[20:29] <ryanviews> That's just rude for starters.

[20:44] <zarkith> TooManyGames? :shrug:
[20:44] <somerandomsatanic> TMG?
[20:44] <fantasmatic2> no
[20:44] <natalietoday> no

[20:44] <theluigiguy> oh boy LUL
[20:44] <natalietoday> i really don't

[20:44] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow do you have a Samsun phone
[20:44] <tiphias> please no
[20:44] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow want me to jump off my roof?
[20:44] <beiman86> id almost rather talk about dickgirls
[20:44] <boscojokey> wraping or raping?
[20:44] <dutchyargo> fidget spinner fetish?
[20:44] <dubemo> please no
[20:44] <somerandomsatanic> FailFish
[20:44] <fantasmatic2> rev don't
[20:44] <elephantboyq> not really.
[20:44] <carbonic0> did any of you guys see that guy play guitar with a fidget spinner?
[20:44] <boostarpictures> @volbia if you have Steam, you could use Source FilmMaker and learn animation :)
[20:44] <ryanviews> That's not a topic I had in mind today...
[20:44] <zarkith> Wait, you talked about a wrapping fetish? Did I just blank out during that 'cause I don't recall that at all
[20:44] <natalietoday> this is a GREAT time for me to go get some tea
[20:45] <zombiehunter6022> Sure Kappa
[20:45] <toasterquestion> What going on? revGasm
[20:45] <beiman86> im waiting to see the spinner sex toys
[20:45] <fantasmatic2> @dutchyargo place a fidget spinner on your dick really tight there and then spin it, like a horrible indian burn
[20:45] <somerandomsatanic> fidget spinners, in my Rev stream? BibleThump
[20:45] <thestarryskye> why did fidget spinners suddenly become hip? they're theraputic
[20:45] <weer_dough> Okay, real question...why does everyone always get up in arms about these things?
[20:45] <carbonic0> kid rev is an amazing voice and im glad i expierenced that
[20:45] <dutchyargo> fidget spinner apply directly to your dick
[20:45] <fantasmatic2> @TheStarrySkye they are therapeutic but because of this fad they're getting banned in quite some places, pretty dissapointing
[20:45] <natalietoday> @Weer_Dough because they've been appropriated as a toy when they're meant to be theraputic for people with ADHD/autism/etc
[20:45] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow did you punch the kid
[20:45] <carbonic0> they are kind of lame, ive seen 1 cool thing done with them
[20:45] <fantasmatic2> @Carbonic0 spinning?
[20:45] <thestarryskye> @Weer_Dough because autistic and adhd people need them to concentrate and now they're fashonable and getting banned by people who don't need them
[20:46] <volbia> What's the point of them?
[20:46] <carbonic0> someone used it to play a guitar lol
[20:46] <carbonic0> its theraputic like @natalietoday said
[20:46] <dutchyargo> theraputic behaviour
[20:46] <zombiehunter6022> @nick2424delcat that's Joel's personality
[20:46] <boostarpictures> I don't have a fidget spinner. I'm such a loser ;p
[20:46] <thestarryskye> @Fantasmatic2 oh I just repeated what you said woops
[20:46] <carbonic0> like the fidget box, it helps people
[20:46] <theluigiguy> oh the glitter case
[20:46] <somerandomsatanic> Yes
[20:46] <punstartracer> LUL
[20:46] <natalietoday> oh you still have the glitter case? fuck yes
[20:46] <elephantboyq> Sparkle
[20:46] <fantasmatic2> @TheStarrySkye that's fine i answered to you in the first place
[20:46] <somerandomsatanic> cool case
[20:46] <zombiehunter6022> @volbia Roy for people with ADHD like me
[20:46] <carbonic0> fidget boxes look really cool
[20:46] <bortonium> less edgy beyblades
[20:46] <hootey> Pogs were never a good idea
[20:46] <dutchyargo> it reminds me of nukes
[20:46] <hootey> We were all just too dumb
[20:46] <thestarryskye> oh hey hootey

[20:46] <beiman86> my wife bought a fidget spinner and i harass her every time i see a meme about them being dumb
[20:46] <dutchyargo> its funny at first, but then it gets creepy

[20:47] <automaticmanic> There are fidget spinners being sold at the local vape shop...
[20:47] <punstartracer> they aren't therapeutic, they have existed for like 2 months no research can be done in 2 months
[20:47] <boostarpictures> @awoodct I would totally do that. :p

[20:47] <thestarryskye> I usually use the pendants on necklaces to fidget
[20:47] <somerandomsatanic> i don't get them either
[20:47] <natalietoday> @PunStarTracer fidget toys in general have indeed been studied thoroughly and are effective

[20:48] <prob_rob> Friend of mine bought one made of gun metal]
[20:48] <natalietoday> @PunStarTracer yeah but the concept isn't new
[20:48] <beiman86> its like people find a couple of ball bearings and gyroscopic motion special
[20:48] <punstartracer> i found one near me for like 11$
[20:48] <somerandomsatanic> i would pay less than 5 dollars
[20:48] <hootey> @Toasterquestion Spent 6 hours on the phone with tech support, so I'm glad I'm home
[20:49] <elephantboyq> $5 to ~$600 I meant

[20:49] <elephantboyq> It's made of vibranium.
[20:49] <fantasmatic2> they call him glass joe
[20:49] <thestarryskye> except fidget spinners actually help people, beanie babies have probably only suffocated a few
[20:49] <prob_rob> Fidget spinners are Firbys
[20:49] <carbonic0> oh man hoots got a puppy?

[21:08] <natalietoday> LUL
[21:08] <somerandomsatanic> LUL gud
[21:09] <blabeep> Mr Robin Hood.
[21:09] <bechuga> can't they trace that kind of stuff?
[21:09] <dutchyargo> he lost his ring either way
[21:09] <carbonic0> never forget homeless black metal man
[21:09] <dutchyargo> it kinda depends on the shadyness of the pawnshop
[21:09] <asrandomly> How to get arrested with Rev livestream when?
[21:09] <bechuga> Rev Hood, spicy man in tights
[21:09] <signalerror> Or he struggled through college, tooth and nail working a full time job and then got that ring as a reward of all his determination
[21:09] <bortonium> it would be theft even if it didn't have his name on it
[21:09] <dutchyargo> yea but his name is proof
[21:10] <elephantboyq> Warheads.
[21:10] <dutchyargo> and you need to leave names at pawnshops if i have to believe 1940's la noir
[21:10] <droliie> swatted
[21:10] <coolcapybara> @RevScarecrow Are you going to shoot Hitler in his 1 ball?
[21:10] <elephantboyq> Right through the sternum.
[21:10] <bechuga> change your name to the one on the ring > it's yours
[21:11] <dutchyargo> theres no detective division for lost and found tho, only burglary and larceny
[21:11] <blabeep> your objective: shoot everyone in the balls
[21:11] <elephantboyq> You even get to shoot the machines in their sparkly balls.
[21:12] <thestarryskye> SCHUT
[21:12] <elephantboyq> Schuut
[21:12] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Flash games: Getting a Virus - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist

[21:12] <fantasmatic2> have a nice day and nut schut stream
[21:12] <somerandomsatanic> bye @Fantasmatic2
[21:12] <weer_dough> I dunno, "Long-Distance-Ball-Shooter 4" doesn't have the same ring to it.
[21:12] <fantasmatic2> HeyGuys
[21:12] <prob_rob> G'bye, Fanta!
[21:12] <bechuga> later levels feature armoured balls
[21:13] <ryanviews> I sure hope ball armor is a thing that exists in this game.
[21:13] <thefocuswobbler> bye @Fantasmatic2
[21:13] <ryanviews> And you have to strategically remove it before going for the nut shot.
[21:13] <bechuga> my summer car is already Finnish
[21:13] <dutchyargo> its not finnished enough?
[21:13] <signalerror> People want my summer car?
[21:13] <somerandomsatanic> <3
[21:13] <elephantboyq> I mean, isn't that what a codpiece is?
[21:13] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow tbh you'd be hard-pressed to find something i wouldn't watch you playing... you make a lot of content way more watchable than it would be on its own
[21:13] <the_gamer_586> I'd watch rev talk to a potato for an hour
[21:14] <elephantboyq> I'd watch him talk about talking.
[21:14] <ryanviews> I mean, yeah, that's a codpiece, but clearly they're not using them. :P
[21:14] <moobot> Wanna have your fan art shown on stream? Post it here http://vinesauce.booru.org/ and Rev will show it at the end of the stream. Make sure to put "rev" tag so he can find it.
[21:14] <prob_rob> I did watch you eat that one corndog earlier on YouTube, I dunno why, but it got me wondering when're you next gonna eat live on camera
[21:14] <dutchyargo> potatos are fascinating
[21:14] <hootey> Please elaborate on the potato.
[21:14] <the_gamer_586> after an hour he switches to a cabbage
[21:14] <carbonic0> get destroyed daron
[21:14] <the_gamer_586> and after that celery
[21:14] <hootey> This is the Wednesday evening content that we deserve.
[21:14] <theluigiguy> LUL
[21:14] <signalerror> Darren drinks way too many potatos to stream
[21:14] <somerandomsatanic> LUL
[21:15] <ryanviews> And I think this is enjoyable! Went over a large number of topics while going for the most unique sniping style. :P
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> or even
[21:15] <theluigiguy> Russet
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> a *gasp* corn
[21:15] <thetunnelsn8ke> Russets are the best kind for sour cream and chive bakeds.
[21:15] <tiphias> did someone mention potatoes? I love potatoes.
[21:15] <carbonic0> corn or potatoes rev
[21:15] <thefocuswobbler> I remember when i was a wee lad that I got Joel confused with Darren for a bit
[21:15] <tiphias> Rev have you ever had a blue potato?
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> corn
[21:15] <thetunnelsn8ke> I could subsist on baked potatoes, though
[21:15] <elephantboyq> Sweet potatoes aren't even potatoes.
[21:15] <blabeep> Sweet potato fries are disgusting
[21:15] <zombiehunter6022> I can watch rev talk about how f ed up Wendy's forever
[21:15] <elephantboyq> They're yams
[21:15] <dutchyargo> aka american
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> "food talk"
[21:15] <natalietoday> i like my potatoes in the form of poutine
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> now that is soemthign I would watch
[21:15] <somerandomsatanic> Sweet potato is meh
[21:15] <carbonic0> Rev is showing off his southern
[21:15] <thetunnelsn8ke> Two of the basic brainfoods
[21:15] <carbonic0> rice potatoes and corn are all pretty great
[21:15] <the_gamer_586> @natalietoday yes
[21:16] <dutchyargo> corn, wheat, rice and potatos are the 4 foods of the world.
[21:16] <the_gamer_586> now that is quality
[21:16] <carbonic0> next thing you know rev is going to talk about grits
[21:16] <ryanviews> Throw in some cornbread with that. Absolutely delicious.
[21:16] <hootey> Rice seeds
[21:16] <ryanviews> Biscuits and Gravy is top tier always.
[21:16] <elephantboyq> rice is a grain iirc
[21:16] <carbonic0> isnt cornbread a super southern thing'
[21:16] <deluxer21> "potatoes are good" - rev 2017
[21:16] <signalerror> Rice is great if you want to eat a thousand of something
[21:16] <hootey> Gotta be honest, was hoping for some really hot potato takes
[21:16] <thetunnelsn8ke> I wish I could include more than just caesar salads into my daily veggies
[21:16] <ryanviews> Yeah, my mom was from Texas before moving up so she made some for me, and it's great.
[21:16] <the_gamer_586> it is
[21:16] <the_gamer_586> but corn bread is pretty good however
[21:16] <natalietoday> @Hootey po-take-oes?
[21:16] <thetoxicavenger666> I wanna try purple potato
[21:16] <carbonic0> cornbread is fantastic though, and im almost all the way up north lol
[21:16] <natalietoday> @Hootey ... i'm sorry
[21:16] <elephantboyq> I mean, I love cornbread, but I'm from Michigan.
[21:17] <the_gamer_586> I'm more of a bean person
[21:17] <natalietoday> @Elephantboyq same on both counts
[21:17] <asrandomly> Well I can't eat music Kappa

[21:17] <limeproselyte> PA is pork and sauerkraut on New Years
[21:17] <ryanviews> I absolutely despise beans. I can't eat them at all.
[21:17] <dutchyargo> imma torture u and mention im making popcorn
[21:17] <thetunnelsn8ke> Coup de grace on that wounded gnatsi
[21:17] <carbonic0> black beans are pretty alright
[21:17] <the_gamer_586> how so ryan?
[21:17] <elephantboyq> Wow, you eat entire bands on a yearly basis?
[21:17] <the_gamer_586> how about frank and beans?
[21:17] <carbonic0> no thats outkast
[21:17] <thefocuswobbler> No that was Outkast
[21:17] <bortonium> that was Outkast
[21:17] <natalietoday> no that was Outkast
[21:17] <somerandomsatanic> no
[21:17] <ryanviews> I dunno! I think it's just the texture of beans. Makes me wanna vomit when I eat them.
[21:17] <thestarryskye> Heya was Outkast
[21:17] <arcibi> the one time i ate black eyed peas for luck on a new year, it was at the beginning of 2016. so yeah i'm never fucking doing that again
[21:17] <carbonic0> NOW WHATS COOLER THEN BEING COOL
[21:17] <the_gamer_586> fair enough
[21:17] <blabeep> ICE COLD
[21:18] <thetoxicavenger666> Black beans and refried are the best
[21:18] <the_gamer_586> I was like that for a while too
[21:18] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow Black Eyed Peas was Boom Boom Pow
[21:18] <zombiehunter6022> @carbonic0 alright alright
[21:18] <carbonic0> NOW LADIES
[21:18] <dutchyargo> kessler is the name of a homeless shelter in our town
[21:18] <the_gamer_586> I got used to them and now I like em with meat
[21:18] <thetoxicavenger666> I could eat black beans any day
[21:18] <thetunnelsn8ke> Yeah hi I'm here for a "Kessler?"
[21:18] <thefocuswobbler> @Carbonic0 @natalietoday @Bortonium @TheStarrySkye We know our stuff SeemsGood
[21:18] <carbonic0> i dont even like hip hop other then death grips lol
[21:18] <tyler81198> ABSOLUTER ZERO, 0K 0K 0K
[21:18] <thetunnelsn8ke> Potatoes are a joy.
[21:18] <bortonium> @thefocuswobbler we are the outkasts
[21:19] <tiphias> you can survive on nothing but potatoes for a long time
[21:19] <thetunnelsn8ke> Potatoes aren't that bad for you unless they're prepared in some fry fashion
[21:19] <prob_rob> Why's that?
[21:19] <thestarryskye> "you shouldn't always eat potatoes" fucking WATCH me
[21:19] <elephantboyq> there's no nutritional value in potatoes. other than calories, pretty much.
[21:19] <carbonic0> potatoes are pretty good, but i wouldnt eat them all the time
[21:19] <natalietoday> same starry
[21:19] <elephantboyq> iirc
[21:19] <asrandomly> Well the irish are just amazing because they are Part Potato themselves
[21:19] <somerandomsatanic> Sky, same
[21:19] <thetunnelsn8ke> Like I said. Subsisting on bakeds.
[21:19] <tyler81198> how many potatoes does it take to kill an irishman? none.
[21:19] <carbonic0> irish are 50% potato
[21:19] <ryanviews> Yeah, I don't think potatos have that many nutrients. You could technically live on them, but it wouldn't be healthy living. :P
[21:19] <elephantboyq> Potatoes have starch in them. Kappa
[21:19] <blabeep> I can survive on 26 cent ramen for several months, doesn't mean i should.
[21:20] <carbonic0> couscous is my jam personally
[21:20] <carbonic0> a friend of mine supposively lived off of ramen and eggs together for $30 a month
[21:20] <theluigiguy> don't do it Rev
[21:20] <thetunnelsn8ke> This is very MGS3 right now
[21:20] <deluxer21> do it

[21:20] <somerandomsatanic> ;3
[21:20] <thestarryskye> no Anakin
[21:20] <ryanviews> I mean you found him! Mission accomplished! Your reward is nut shotting him. :P

[21:21] <carbonic0> yes anakin yes,
[21:21] <carbonic0> kill him
[21:21] <deluxer21> ASS SHOT
[21:21] <elephantboyq> start from the checkpoint.
[21:21] <thefocuswobbler> @TheTunnelSn8ke I get a MGS3 vibe from BOTW
[21:21] <thestarryskye> nut shots aren't lethal
[21:21] <carbonic0> kill him now
[21:21] <thetunnelsn8ke> That's all well and good but GET YOUR FAT ASS UP
