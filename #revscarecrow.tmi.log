[21:10] <faldenvi> Maybe if you pee on it, it'll cool the things down
[21:10] <will99222> Everything I'm seeing is saying you have the carburetor too lean, as in fuel air mix.
[21:10] <alexxerth> why ARE you like this? What IS wrong with you?
[21:10] <iansolo45> dipstick Kreygasm
[21:10] <dapoel> @FaldenVI Peing on things susually gets tem hot Kappa
[21:10] <hallowedguru> yes brake fluid goes straight into the engine
[21:11] <theluigiguy> ๐ค
[21:11] <deluxer21> rev you're forgetting the headlight fluid
[21:11] <truelunar> @RevScarecrow i think its becaused when i paid with paypal it borked the first time when chrome crashed and it sent you a sub even though paypal didn't notify me (and make it go through) untill the retry
[21:11] <bechuga> Happy Birthday Daddy!
[21:11] <legendcasque> Jesus Christ, Rev, when did you drive through a cotton candy factory?
[21:11] <outsiderxt> Vapourwave the car
[21:11] <punstartracer> @legendcasque is called style, look it up
[21:11] <docjackal2> How much of a breakdown would Rev have if the car just exploded
[21:11] <dapoel> I have to fucking check my messages before sending them, I type too fast and make spelling mistakes that shouldn't be there
[21:11] <isghj> like a fishing lure
[21:11] <docjackal2> Anime
[21:11] <deluxer21> @docjackal2 I think he would just close the stream

[21:12] <lt_shadow> Any one excited about "Code Vein" From Bandi Namco?
[21:12] <natalietoday> KappaPride
[21:12] <aiden_of_the_light> Stream more of that Kappa
[21:12] <will99222> Yeah it looks like you need to tune your carburetor, if its got too much air access it burns too hot and makes black smoke.
[21:12] <thestarryskye> nick no
[21:12] <docjackal2> Raunch dressing
[21:12] <punstartracer> KappaPride
[21:12] <sleepwalkin> Needs more Carbs. Add a subway sandwich.
[21:12] <thestarryskye> brb
[21:12] <will99222> adjust the air rocker somehow
[21:12] <moobot> If you like Rev's stuff subscribe to his youtube page https://www.youtube.com/user/RevScarecrow or if you missed something check out his full stream channel https://www.youtube.com/revscarecrowafterhours
[21:12] <iansolo45> add spaghetti
[21:12] <isghj> tune it so that it takes less fuel per air
[21:12] <iansolo45> PJSalt
[21:13] <dapoel> Eyup, seems like ya need to replace your radio fluid, that'll be 15000 dollars
[21:13] <jadedbunny84> moms spaghetti
[21:13] <isghj> you need a tuning fork
[21:13] <docjackal2> Roomor
[21:13] <dapoel> finnbucks*
[21:13] <hallowedguru> probably a marketing ploy
[21:13] <dapoel> PJSalt
[21:13] <shuuspillow> in the 7th grade my friend told me they wipe their asses with the wraps
[21:13] <bechuga> sounds like Taco Bull
[21:13] <c_c_lapew> Best way to tune the carb is get the mixture gauge
[21:13] <will99222> ok you need to take the rocker off
[21:13] <deluxer21> I mean most American fast food is terrible
[21:13] <faldenvi> I think American food already has plenty of salt, eh
[21:13] <legendcasque> Those taco burritos are good, but I don't know if trhey're still there.
[21:13] <deluxer21> like even Subway
[21:14] <jeddostotle7> hmm.... skeptical that Taco Bell is anywhere near the realm of something that won't make you get diahrrea

[21:14] <osomister> keep in mind that also you can go on the lean shit
[21:14] <will99222> @RevScarecrow you need to take the rocker off the top
[21:14] <iansolo45> PogChamp
[21:14] <hallowedguru> taco bell has no real reason to make their food healthier when it currently sells perfectly fine despite being garbage shaped like food
[21:14] <dapoel> oh no
[21:14] <sleepwalkin> That controls the flow.
[21:14] <natalietoday> @Jeddostotle7 i used to work there and still eat there all the time and have never had that reaction lol
[21:14] <legendcasque> The taste of a Big Mac is kind of dominated by the sauce and pickles.
[21:14] <dapoel> @RevScarecrow Do you think you can cram some stardew at the end of the stream
[21:14] <billy96_> ignition thingy
[21:14] <hallowedguru> especially since making food healthier is usually more difficult/expensive
[21:14] <billy96_> no wait, throttle thingy
[21:14] <c_c_lapew> It a screw..not a bolt
[21:15] <dapoel> I think I'm going to fucking aim for the swear counter
[21:15] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow wow for once it's not me that's asking about s t a r d e w Kappa
[21:15] <jeddostotle7> SAME
[21:15] <natalietoday> @Dapoel why the fuck would you want to do that shit MiniK
[21:15] <dapoel> @natalietoday ur welcome Kappa
[21:15] <hallowedguru> that's why fast food exists
[21:15] <dapoel> fucking shithead
[21:15] <will99222> @RevScarecrow the part you toggled there is what your accelerator pedal pulls. anyway there is a screw just under the rocker (on the FRONT end of the car) which tunes it. you saw it there
[21:15] <natalietoday> LMAO i was literally saying that same exact thing today in Discord
[21:15] <jeddostotle7> I need to workout more, and yet I never get to doing it
[21:15] <meaty_refrigerator37> rev needs to get swole
[21:15] <natalietoday> "yeah i'll go to the gym after work" *goes directly home*
[21:15] <c_c_lapew> Tune it with the engine running
[21:15] <will99222> now try running the engine
[21:15] <jadedbunny84> I always say I need to work out more too
[21:16] <shuuspillow> u gotta live a long and healthy life for momo ๐บ
[21:16] <dapoel> We need Rev to get fucking SWOLE
[21:16] <punstartracer> eating healthy? yes i add extra lettuce Kappa
[21:16] <hallowedguru> people these days are always busy or on the go, so we're all just like "as long as its cheap and quick and edible i dont give a fuck"
[21:16] <hallowedguru> not that i'm criticizing
[21:16] <deluxer21> "Yeah I'll do X after work/school" *doesn't do X* describes so many lives
[21:16] <hallowedguru> i'm the same
[21:16] <isghj> just fill jugs with water
[21:16] <punstartracer> @deluxer21 that's my mantra
[21:16] <meaty_refrigerator37> depends on what you'r elooking for, rev. body weight stuff is all you REALLY need
[21:17] <meaty_refrigerator37> r/bodyweightfitness for those interested

[21:18] <dapoel> I see what you're doing Natalie, trying to get the #1 post possition, shit
[21:18] <will99222> @RevScarecrow the carboretor is also why you've been backfiring your engine for the past few streams

[21:20] <nevy4256> @revscarecrow I had an idea. Why not enable YouTube chat so YouTube people can talk amongst themselves?
[21:20] <dapoel> @Jeddostotle7 don't shrug me, ill cut oyu

[21:21] <namelessrumia> did he drive anywhere yet?
[21:21] <nevy4256> Oh.
[21:21] <jeddostotle7> That's YouTube comments/streamchat distilled
[21:21] <nevy4256> Ohh.
[21:21] <tyloranime> streams crapping for me, thx wifi
[21:21] <deluxer21> Youtube chat doesn't have any moderation tools whatsoever
[21:21] <deluxer21> I mean it does
[21:21] <flametitan> Yeah I watch on yt and I don't recommend yt chat
[21:21] <punstartracer> im not from america but if i had teleportation skills
[21:21] <lt_shadow> TFW you get Dire but no Joel or Limes limesThump
[21:21] <osomister> good
[21:21] <truelunar> @deluxer21 if they did then the comments would be way better
[21:21] <dapoel> I would just leave it on if I were you Rev
[21:22] <deluxer21> Youtube has a much wider audience
[21:22] <tomokithecoffeecup> hi guys
[21:22] <will99222> @RevScarecrow sometimes saving and loading tweaks a screw or bolt for no reason.
[21:22] <tyloranime> hi
[21:22] <isghj> you added fluids right
[21:22] <hallowedguru> they introduced a moderation system for comments
[21:22] <hallowedguru> so i'd think they'd have done it for stream chat as well
[21:22] <lt_shadow> Does Dire not live in England also?
[21:22] <truelunar> @HallowedGuru well i sure as hell havn't seen an improvement
[21:22] <nevy4256> I wish I could go to any convention, not even just to meet people from Vinesauce but to experience a con.
[21:22] <deluxer21> Twitch is kind of specialty, although there are still hundreds of thousands of users
[21:22] <dapoel> The problem with youtube is that it has a somewhat explotaible moderation system
[21:22] <holopleather> revStop
[21:22] <punstartracer> 90% of YouTube streams are "XBOX PSN STEAM CARDS FOLLOW FOR FREE GIVEAWAY"
[21:22] <punstartracer> I swear
[21:22] <dapoel> specially with copyright
[21:23] <egoangell> Ya fix the car yet son???
[21:23] <bechuga> muurica
[21:23] <isghj> isn't dire ohio?
[21:23] <tomokithecoffeecup> @PunStarTracer true
[21:23] <deluxer21> @PunStarTracer There's good shit too, like that one "lo-fi tunes for studying" one
[21:23] <c_c_lapew> That's because you need to have the engine running to adjust the carb. Start your engine warm it up, then with the engine running adjust the carb until the smoke from the exhaust pipe turns gray, not
[21:23] <truelunar> @PunStarTracer "hot babe porno live. online in 5hrs"
[21:23] <hallowedguru> @TrueLunar I think that's because comments are harder to care about than chats
[21:23] <hallowedguru> I mean, it's like

[21:35] <truelunar> light shit on fire @RevScarecrow
[21:35] <turduckenpie> Hey Rev, hey chat
[21:35] <lt_shadow> Little inferno holy shit didn't that come out in like 2010?
[21:35] <dapoel> It's a game about burinign things in a chimney @RevScarecrow
[21:35] <c_c_lapew> Without oil
[21:35] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow you set things on fire in your fireplace
[21:35] <dapoel> from the same devs as world of goo @RevScarecrow
[21:35] <deluxer21> Little Inferno is enjoyable, once
[21:35] <dagothorsim> That is absolutely leaking
[21:35] <deluxer21> But that once lasts pretty long
[21:35] <theluigiguy> duct tape that shit Kappa
[21:35] <punstartracer> i got banned lol
[21:35] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow yeah it's older but it's basically "set shit on fire" sandbox lol
[21:35] <dapoel> @deluxer21 pretty much
[21:35] <tomokithecoffeecup> use some glue
[21:35] <neutrino431> LUL
[21:36] <isghj> is it copper or allum?
[21:36] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow it's pretty comfy though so i figured you might like it
[21:36] <dapoel> Just buy a new car Rev Kappa
[21:36] <panevala> It might be breaking because the entire front end is inside of your ungine
[21:36] <hallowedguru> well that's kinda how cars can be in real life
[21:36] <topkekfur> this car is the perfect shitbox
[21:36] <hallowedguru> shit just breaks
[21:36] <dapoel> because it's a pice of shit
[21:36] <deluxer21> Just sell it for scrap and start over
[21:36] <alexxerth> @RevScarecrow have you tried reversing the polarity of the neutron flow?
[21:36] <turduckenpie> rip
[21:36] <will99222> Maybe it went like that when you C R A S H E D it
[21:36] <swinabc> life sucks and then you die
[21:36] <turduckenpie> Take it to the mech?

[21:37] <truelunar> take it to the mechanic
[21:37] <dapoel> revD
[21:37] <bechuga> why not?

[21:37] <namelessrumia> capitalism
[21:37] <chucklercheese> BibleThump
[21:37] <hallowedguru> because life sucks

[21:37] <outsiderxt> This is the true summer car experience.
[21:37] <will99222> @RevScarecrow crashing can damage the engine block which can cause leaking engines.
[21:37] <tyloranime> can you see me, the chat is not moving
[21:37] <natalietoday> @tyloranime yes
[21:37] <getoffmydamnlawn> on todays news: Residential Texas Man Angry at Car and Takes him 5 years to Fix

[21:37] <lt_shadow> @swinabc Did you hear DSp apparently lost his Youtube Partner ship?
[21:37] <zombiehunter6022> macbooks? auto destruction?
[21:37] <dapoel> Why don't you take it to the inspector so that he gives you a list of everything that's wrong so that you can fix it @RevScarecrow
[21:38] <anonymous64bit> Hi Rev are you suffering yet?
[21:38] <swinabc> he had a partnership?
[21:38] <tyloranime> no its not moving at all
[21:38] <topkekfur> macbooks are quite unreliable little things
[21:38] <will99222> @zombiehunter6022 everything being soldered together and you cant fix if one single thing breaks
[21:38] <dubtalia> @Lt_Shadow I heard he is with a new partnership, but some speculate it might be a scam
[21:38] <isghj> white smoke can mean burning coolant past the head gasket right?
[21:38] <will99222> i bet you wont pass again
[21:38] <topkekfur> keep an eye for the temp
[21:38] <zombiehunter6022> @will99222 no the macbooks
[21:38] <anonymous64bit> Chat, is he suffering yet?
[21:38] <dapoel> @RevScarecrow so? I knew you passed but that doesn't mean you can't get anoter inspection
[21:38] <truelunar> @RevScarecrow i think i have identified the problem. cars are not supposed to look like used paper bags
[21:38] <bechuga> might end up being My Winter Car soon
[21:38] <topkekfur> if you run it too hot for too much time it will damage the engine
[21:39] <swinabc> lol DSP is like a Shakespears character
[21:39] <hallowedguru> @Anonymous64bit yes
[21:39] <tyloranime> ay i can see chat now

[21:43] <c_c_lapew> Rev.... your out of oil... it's empty
[21:43] <dapoel> How many Revs does it take to build a functional car? Kappa
[21:44] <tomokithecoffeecup> 69
[21:44] <thestarryskye> @Monolithic_erection oh man my first car was a 96 jeep and I was feeling shaky on the interstate

[21:45] <getoffmydamnlawn> this alien speak
[21:45] <natalietoday> the oil light is definitely on
[21:45] <hallowedguru> if you have an infinite number of revs try to build an infinite number of cars, eventually one of them will build a functional vehicle
[21:45] <yoshifan501> So the other day my car wouldn't start, and it was because the battery died, and while my dad was trying to remove the battery, i was playing the death song on my phone, and when we had to go to the auto parts store, we had to take none other than my mom's blue van. and i shouted IM GOIN TO LOPPE!
[21:45] <dapoel> So I think it's a good idea to give up on the bodywork and just got racing RIGHT NOW
[21:45] <dagg215> ORA ORA ORA
[21:45] <topkekfur> its gonna damage the engine if you run it without engine oil
[21:45] <c_c_lapew> Your oil light is on ffs

[22:01] <hallowedguru> i think he means the mobile app
[22:01] <willyahm19> app
[22:01] <somerandomsatanic> App
[22:01] <mrpokemon8778> app
[22:01] <dondoran85> yep, that's my name
[22:01] <mrpokemon8778> people use phones rev
[22:01] <lordofriez> app
[22:01] <dapoel> app I think
[22:01] <robrobrevolution> This is now Rev's life.
[22:01] <truelunar> i ment Told
[22:01] <imbloodydeadinside> I'm on my phone ๐
[22:01] <dapoel> hurrr
[22:01] <truelunar> fuck
[22:01] <panevala> Didn't twitch buy curse? I think you can watch on the curse thing now.
[22:01] <tyloranime> APP
[22:01] <topkekfur> ive watched this since first stream, best series
[22:01] <thestarryskye> rev eat something before your brain dies
[22:01] <namelessrumia> ๐
[22:01] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow I've heard that hydrogen or nitrogen fueled cars is becoming a thing
[22:01] <dapoel> this is just sad at this point, put the radio on at least
[22:01] <deluxer21> I thought Curse merged with Twitch
[22:02] <will99222> I think Amazon bought curse.
[22:02] <dagothorsim> I know the curse launcher is now a twitch thing, but I know I at least have not figured out how to make it do anything
[22:02] <willyahm19> so how far do you have to push this car?
[22:02] <truelunar> @zombiehunter6022 they are, got a hundai add for one in my science mag
[22:02] <drox> yeah curse got bought by twitch
[22:02] <simmer122> Ooooh that happened to me too, that makes sense.
[22:02] <budbreathpanda> Amazon owns all the things now.
[22:02] <deluxer21> @DagothOrsim It's really really good for Minecraft mods at least
[22:02] <namelessrumia> twitch is an amazon company yeah
[22:02] <mister_maow> This game needs a tow truck you can call.
[22:02] <dondoran85> what? man, I haven't loaded Curse in ages
[22:02] <will99222> just tow it in with the can
[22:02] <will99222> van, even
[22:02] <mister_maow> And twitch is owned by amazon.
[22:02] <zombiehunter6022> I've heard apple and Disney are planning to merge
[22:02] <dondoran85> Curse had decent voice chat too, not sure if it's still good
[22:02] <panevala> Curse really helps with MMO addons if you're in to that sort of thing.
[22:02] <imbloodydeadinside> So is it bad that I'm addicted to watching your flash game streams on after hours ๐
[22:03] <eternallineage> It's weird that I use the twitch app to download WoW addons now
[22:03] <billy96_> Nah
[22:03] <dondoran85> there are worse things to be addicted to
[22:03] <zreserve> huh
[22:03] <thestarryskye> Door Dan VoHiYo
[22:03] <dapoel> it's amazing that Rev has managed to learn the layout of the map I stilll have no idea how it goes
[22:03] <truelunar> it does good for KSP too
[22:03] <dondoran85> heya Starry rev5
[22:03] <deluxer21> Minecraft mods are literally single click install with the launcher thing, it's a godsend
[22:03] <zombiehunter6022> screenwave is avgn right?
[22:03] <deluxer21> Yes
[22:03] <lt_shadow> Yeah for a game that's all about the modsthey sure as fuck made it hard
[22:03] <imbloodydeadinside> but the flash games are so cancerous but i can't stop watching it ๐

[22:10] <flametitan> What about towing him into the lake and drowning him, making you the only competitor?
[22:10] <legendcasque> No you can't, Rev, that would imply getting in front of him first.
[22:10] <beiman86> rev you dont race with anybody, its just times set for you to beat

[22:10] <will99222> Your plans scare me
[22:10] <7djames7> @RevScarecrow Nekopara is basically a VN with catgirls working at a pastry shop. Thr art is really good, the character outfits really well designed, and the story is pretty basic. Would recommend if you like catgirls.
