[19:07] <robrobrevolution> Hey luigi
[19:07] <thestarryskye> tho it's a crime they brought back Jeffrey Combs to voice a DC character and it wasn't the Question
[19:08] <tyrianplays> Rev is far away

[19:08] <elephantboyq> Time to argue w/ himself
[19:08] <egoangell> Just add it gdi its drag and drop
[19:08] <thebeastygerbil> I love rev talking to himself
[19:08] <lt_shadow> some one should animate this in SFM

[19:09] <thestarryskye> do we have to kinkshame the kinkshamer

[19:09] <moobot> On mobile but wanna support the channel? You can subscribe with this link! https://www.twitch.tv/products/revscarecrow/ticket New Emotes at 250 (215/250 Subscribers)
[19:09] <sad_spaghetti> wow that's a long to-do list
[19:09] <shuuspillow> hes one step close to tht goal
[19:09] <werewhiskey_> eh, id say thats just one hell of a case of narcissm
[19:09] <thetoxicavenger666> @RevScarecrow I could make you a playlist for this game consisting of Finnish metal from 1995 and earlier if you really want but I cannot guarantee anything will not get copyright shit but I doubt it will since I listen to "obscure" stuff. It bugs me that this game takes place in 1995 and yet has music from like 2011
[19:09] <hallowedguru> if you fuck a clone of yourself is that masturbation
[19:09] <cserbapeti> Squid1 Squid2 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[19:09] <moobot> No excessive use of emotes allowed (cserbapeti) (warning)
[19:09] <werewhiskey_> not necessarily something that's worthy of kinkshaming
[19:09] <isghj> can you imagine a future where you teach an AI to speak in your own voice so you can talk to your AI who is you
[19:09] <punstartracer> maybe?

[19:12] <flithy_lucio_main> Now Rev and Then Rev should fuck
[19:12] <punstartracer> pro strats
[19:12] <errantwitch> @RevScarecrow That was a productive one-way conversation with a recording you made! :D
[19:12] <robrobrevolution> Past Rev wont know we talked shit about him
[19:12] <lt_shadow> "I mean shit"
[19:12] <kiesa5> How far have you gotten in building the car?
[19:12] <carbonic0> i think they got rid of the bits for ads
[19:12] <somerandomsatanic> @Carbonic0 no it works
[19:12] <punstartracer> he got it built, then he crashed it
[19:13] <kiesa5> Lmao
[19:13] <theluigiguy> Bits for ads still works
[19:13] <carbonic0> im not getting the option
[19:13] <kevinmunchybuttons> by the soundcloud version
[19:13] <theluigiguy> hmm
[19:13] <samiam1616> I still have the option to get bits for ads
[19:13] <somerandomsatanic> its just finicky as hell
[19:13] <natalietoday> @Carbonic0 it's still there but it's iffy, i don't get it very often
[19:13] <biggus_fishus> I still have the option to get bits for ads, it just doesn't work
[19:13] <carbonic0> could be buggy
[19:13] <flametitan> I never had bits for ads working
[19:13] <punstartracer> pubguh
[19:13] <komppu> I never had bits for ads (Finland)
[19:13] <thebeastygerbil> Weeb shit
[19:13] <theluigiguy> Ads for Bits is kinda erratic
[19:13] <kiesa5> "technically"
[19:13] <sad_spaghetti> if thats true im never getting bits
[19:13] <egoangell> Why not just play the yt video for redvox
[19:13] <samiam1616> Though I can only get them once a day now
[19:13] <offlineheadass> Why dont you just download the MP3's from youtube
[19:13] <freyja_fenris_tyrmitore> It's still there, but sometimes it comes up as "Buy bits" for me every so often. Refreshing fixes it.
[19:13] <somerandomsatanic> <3 <3
[19:13] <werewhiskey_> @RevScarecrow i bought the digital albums so if you'd like i can send you the folders?
[19:14] <gamebuster21> Does the Twitch money go into the corn dog fund?
[19:14] <theluigiguy> :)
[19:14] <werewhiskey_> awww
[19:14] <carbonic0> atom bomb best song off of that album
[19:14] <natalietoday> awwww
[19:14] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[19:14] <somerandomsatanic> how nice of him
[19:14] <werewhiskey_> alright, rev
[19:14] <thebeastygerbil> l o s s l e s s f l a c
[19:14] <creatureellie> I've almost been listening nonstop to red Vox lately
[19:14] <werewhiskey_> wait so was that a yes or no
[19:14] <punstartracer> <3
[19:14] <natalietoday> how much does a corndog cost
[19:14] <theluigiguy> So the official food of The Pit is corndogs
[19:14] <theluigiguy> I approve
[19:14] <somerandomsatanic> LUL
[19:14] <carbonic0> in the garden is pretty good too
[19:14] <creatureellie> I love the music so much <3
[19:14] <kiesa5> Crashed it, huh? Another innocent Satsuma taken by keyboard driving :(
[19:14] <somerandomsatanic> Corndog is the best food Keepo
[19:14] <arcibi> i'm struggling to think of anything that's more gremlin food than corn dogs
[19:14] <sad_spaghetti> idk rev i think thats what they call being a good friend
[19:14] <shuuspillow> i heard you can own a tiger in parts of texas if true, time 2 get momo a friend
[19:15] <carbonic0> the best part about living in vermont is that nobody near me is both good and wants to be in a band
[19:15] <thebeastygerbil> never od on corndogs
[19:15] <thestarryskye> @Arcibi pizza bagels?
[19:15] <egoangell> @arcibi dorito
[19:15] <jedirule1> thats just decency. EVERYONE DOES THAT
[19:15] <offlineheadass> well, i mean wouldn't it be easier to download the mp3's than rip the cd? sorry to be a nag
[19:15] <werewhiskey_> "side hustle"?? cmonBruh
[19:15] <kiesa5> Corndogs seem like the most caveman food ever
[19:15] <theluigiguy> i think the CD has the raw files
[19:15] <fiddox> This is starting to remind me of a Ross Scott video.
[19:15] <robrobrevolution> Side hustle sounds like selling drugs or women.
[19:15] <theluigiguy> don't quote me on that
[19:15] <somerandomsatanic> CD should have the files
[19:15] <fiddox> Probably just Rev's voice.
[19:15] <1cheekym8> hobby
[19:15] <somerandomsatanic> i hope
[19:16] <kiesa5> "I think the CD has the raw files" - theluigiguy
[19:16] <jedirule1> hmm, must be a Cali thing also.
[19:16] <werewhiskey_> lol
[19:16] <punstartracer> i need raw red vox files so i can songsmith them
[19:16] <creatureellie> @kiesa5 Kappa
[19:16] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow it implies that the separation between getting paid and doing what you love is something good
[19:16] <theluigiguy> @kiesa5 revStop
[19:16] <sad_spaghetti> @Kiesa5 i think rev is a cave gremlin tbh
[19:16] <thestarryskye> I need the raw Red Vox files to snort
[19:16] <punstartracer> i did it with an mpg but i couldn't isolate the drums
[19:16] <robrobrevolution> Side bullshit is bullshit
[19:16] <somerandomsatanic> it is
[19:16] <offlineheadass> i wanna snort some mp3's
[19:16] <shuuspillow> such a strange concept
[19:16] <jedirule1> except it mostly involves rap mixtapes.
[19:17] <dratinigirl> you're right, I'm an artist too and my family treats it like my "side project"
[19:17] <nillard> Hey can you do this art for me I can't pay but it'll be really good for your portfolio
[19:17] <kevinmunchybuttons> twitch is revBYPE blocking me
[19:17] <lt_shadow> But Rev do you believe in paying for pornography?
[19:17] <holopleather> supporting artist is more important to me than buying useless shit
[19:17] <tiphias> it's the idea that the thing that sustains you for a living is supposed to be something you loathe
[19:17] <jaback11> @RevScarecrow I've only just started watching you. What is this "weeb job"
[19:17] <creatureellie> @lt_shadow the truest form
[19:17] <sad_spaghetti> just pound the CD into dust and mix it into some vodka
[19:17] <bonebroth> @RevScarecrow reccomend a good punk band from there?
[19:17] <kiesa5> If you pay for pornography, you are more caveman than corndog eaters
[19:17] <natalietoday> cheer150 does this cover the cost of a corndog?
[19:17] <punstartracer> @Jaback11 he manages the twitter of a weeb shop
[19:17] <egoangell> Crumbum apparently
[19:17] <itsmycoolname> @RevScarecrow are you expecting an influx of high quality punk music considering the current political climate?
[19:17] <somerandomsatanic> BYPE
[19:17] <thestarryskye> personally I like doing art on the side because it takes the pressure off
[19:17] <robrobrevolution> Rev watches anime all day, what a nerd Kappa
[19:18] <robrobrevolution> revBYPE
[19:18] <jedirule1> If you pay for porn that isnt Zone, your a fuckingidiot.

[19:18] <nscastie> how are you alive

[19:22] <biggus_fishus> I have paid for porn. I have no regrets
[19:22] <modestglottis> we need regulations on the amount of porn you are allowed per day

[19:23] <nick2424delcat> daddy?
[19:23] <jedirule1> might need the tow.
[19:23] <flametitan> I've paid for some porn before. It's worth it, depending on the porn
[19:23] <shuuspillow> paying for porn helps the actors plus makes fucked up stuff kosher
[19:23] <afrosamurai5643> weeb food LUL
[19:23] <punstartracer> there's a ramen restaurant on my city that is just weeb shit

[19:24] <tacosaladmaster> How old were you guys?
[19:24] <holopleather> what
[19:24] <heyman1231> what!?
[19:24] <somerandomsatanic> Yep
[19:24] <heyman1231> oh
[19:24] <kiesa5> Who the fuck actually cares?
[19:24] <natalietoday> yeah, the filming of porn is illegal in the majority of states in the US
[19:24] <heyman1231> the condom thing
[19:24] <egoangell> Was blenderfucker and guy who jacks it to the appliance magazine?
[19:24] <afrosamurai5643> There was a time I had a shit ton of extra money after getting a really good job and wanted to know what it was like to pay for porn
[19:24] <jedirule1> how did the class react?
[19:24] <somerandomsatanic> @TacoSaladMaster doing good
[19:24] <shuuspillow> i meant kosher for like kinks that are questionable like sleeping stuff
[19:24] <nscastie> I MEAN... YEAH THEY SHOULD????
[19:24] <thestarryskye> @Afrosamurai5643 the intoxicating power of capitalism
[19:24] <punstartracer> PogChamp
[19:24] <kiesa5> Oh no, you gave the succ without him having a condom on, prison for you
[19:25] <creatureellie> revDay
[19:25] <tacosaladmaster> Congrats
[19:25] <carbonic0> i feel like paying for porn is like paying for mods
[19:25] <robrobrevolution> But really, snapchat would be out of business if porn was illegal
[19:25] <modestglottis> paying people is the illegal part, you can film all the porn you want
[19:25] <heyman1231> not the S U C C
[19:25] <afrosamurai5643> @TheStarrySkye right? It was empowering
[19:25] <sad_spaghetti> ive listened to worse presentations
[19:25] <carbonic0> sometimes the mods are good, sometimes they are trash
[19:25] <jedirule1> But what about the money shots?
[19:25] <kiesa5> Paying for mods? Oh god, steam flashbacks..
[19:25] <modestglottis> since you are kinda paying for sex... just sex thats getting recorded
[19:25] <natalietoday> paying your mods? obviously a good idea KappaHD
[19:25] <theluigiguy> paying for porn mods
[19:25] <surprisespurdo> fug
[19:25] <somerandomsatanic> zero people give a shit
[19:25] <isghj> except the senior project
[19:25] <grilledyakisoba> nothing in this world is free
[19:25] <carbonic0> quick pay luigi
[19:25] <guywhoiam> In college there was this guy who gave a presentation about how to fertilize corn or something and I was so bored I started laughing.
[19:25] <chucklercheese> i know i took a speech class
[19:25] <kiesa5> You're a casual for doing that
[19:25] <steezles> @theluigiguy Two birds one stone.
[19:25] <somerandomsatanic> ;3
[19:25] <faldenvi> I was still always nervous af about public speaking, even if no one actually cared
[19:25] <jedirule1> good
[19:25] <biggus_fishus> What about buying hentai games?
[19:25] <heyman1231> it ait driving anywhere
[19:25] <werewhiskey_> what were some other topics that others talked about in that class?
[19:26] <grilledyakisoba> Unless you're a cannibal
[19:26] <surprisespurdo> Freedom ain't free
[19:26] <platypus_nuggets> Basically, if your into really fucked up shit it can be worth it.
[19:26] <carbonic0> what about paying for hentai can we talk about that
[19:26] <thestarryskye> I mean, porn stars are required to undergo extensive STD testing, but I feel like condoms are just a healthy sexual practice
[19:26] <carbonic0> since it isnt recorded
[19:26] <offlineheadass> i had a kid do a report on why school shootings should be legal and i dont think he had alot of friends
[19:26] <grandwizardmiller> lazy gamer
[19:26] <carlolothario> hey Rev?
[19:26] <punstartracer> is gay porn legal
[19:26] <carbonic0> not in texas
[19:26] <punstartracer> 🤔
[19:26] <heyman1231> Roses are red, Violets are blue, use a condom, or its jail for you
[19:26] <steezles> Pornstars have the cleanest genitalia

[19:26] <sad_spaghetti> in my speech class last semester one guy gave a 15 minute presentation on how to start a lawnmower
[19:26] <chucklercheese> it was manditory so everyone was like ughhh
[19:26] <jedirule1> shit yeah you buy them! Someone had to draw that shit.
[19:26] <somerandomsatanic> ello @CarloLothario
[19:26] <steezles> They have to keep it clean though.
[19:26] <nscastie> honestly hentai and anime in general have more time put into them with animation and stuff imo
[19:26] <xir0> Something I learned in college was that if you sit in a group with friends there WILL without fail be someone who comes up to the group asking for you to sign a petition
[19:26] <heyman1231> true
[19:26] <tacosaladmaster> Nice ignition boi
[19:26] <gamebuster21> You can't see all of our judgmental faces staring back at you.

[19:27] <kiesa5> The dev said he's going to add seatbelt
[19:27] <thestarryskye> @CarloLothario we're talking about porn
[19:27] <theluigiguy> i think the animators might be used to it
[19:27] <grilledyakisoba> Is it bad that I look forward to costco in hawaii

[19:36] <carlolothario> understand themself
[19:36] <samiam1616> Granted, art's subjective, but boy it's a little ridiculous at times
[19:36] <ginclevertitle> thanls
[19:36] <carlolothario> not understand others but as well as yourself too
[19:36] <heyman1231> can someone mod this game to add a fidget spiner

[19:36] <ginclevertitle> When is rev going to un people over
[19:36] <punstartracer> i got to bullshit through my history class just by telling the teacher "i did the lesson, but i have it in another notebook" and i never did anything
[19:36] <ruviz> But is it art if someone claims to be an artist by throwing paint randomly into a canvas?
[19:36] <jiggymaster24> You gotta know how thinly you can spread the bullshit before you get caught
[19:36] <gaberaham_lincoln> Everyone poops
[19:36] <carlolothario> Right
[19:36] <shuuspillow> painting with her tits? thats a talent
[19:36] <jedirule1> but we have people who paint a room white and call it art.
[19:36] <somerandomsatanic> yeah
[19:36] <ruviz> Literally throwing paint
[19:36] <chancelloroflights> that guy that paints with his pnis
[19:37] <afrosamurai5643> do you think I could rent an art gallery and fill it with nothing but Empty canvases and nothing else and call it absence? @RevScarecrow
[19:37] <theluigiguy> creativity is wonderful
[19:37] <origfx> I've been a graphic designer for 9 years now, no formal education. SeemsGood
[19:37] <modestglottis> i saw a video of a dude without hand or arms painting
[19:37] <actuallysortahere> I can do art. I can't understand art though.
[19:37] <theluigiguy> it's just whether YOU think it looks great
[19:37] <zarkith> The same can be said for game development
[19:37] <steezles> I like art from people from who has synesthesia
[19:37] <topkekfur> what is art?
[19:37] <robrobrevolution> Oh look, beer on the side of the road
[19:37] <natalietoday> we're all our own worst critics
[19:37] <boscojokey> dosent mean it will be good
[19:37] <laboominc> @RevScarecrow I am doing an animation as my final project a t school. Can I shamelessly link it to you when it's done?
[19:37] <heyman1231> I GOTTA GO, swamp cinnema is playing austin powers
[19:37] <actuallysortahere> I also can't do good art.
[19:37] <egoangell> @afrosamurai5643 the title would be "this space for rent" Kappa
[19:37] <ginclevertitle> KILL REV YOU KNOW YOU MUST KILL
[19:37] <sad_spaghetti> fine but what about the dog who can paint his own name.
[19:37] <jedirule1> I think someone did that already, afrosamurai
[19:38] <deeptron> I want to do art but i suck at coloring
[19:38] <sad_spaghetti> try and top that
[19:38] <foxemperoradxnsp> I cannot do art
[19:38] <last_big_boss> lol
[19:38] <theluigiguy> I try
[19:38] <ilovelucario> did your computer actually get a virus from that last flashgame stream???
[19:38] <creatureellie> Our teacher in college made us do painting when studying imaginative and creative play, we all had to draw someone in the class and we kept apologising to each other. She was just like "you apologise to each other and laugh at it but you wouldn't laugh at a child's work, what makes this any different? You should be encouraging each other" (something along the lines of that)
[19:38] <foxemperoradxnsp> Wait, cooking is a form of art, I can art
[19:38] <origfx> Some artists just have shitty taste
[19:38] <theluigiguy> slow and steady progress
[19:38] <gaberaham_lincoln> Art's like any other skill. So long as you're willing to engage with it, you can do it.
[19:38] <ruviz> ^
[19:38] <shuuspillow> cooking is the yummiest of arts
[19:38] <tiphias> eyy that's me
[19:38] <theluigiguy> @creatureellie that's really poignant
[19:38] <afrosamurai5643> I've met a lot of art students when I worked at an art school. A lot of them were stuck up assholes
[19:38] <jedirule1> I personaly feel art is running out of ideas
[19:38] <creatureellie> I don't understand that word hecc
[19:38] <ginclevertitle> ;_;

[19:40] <jiggymaster24> damn
[19:40] <crackcrackers> I have an artist friend who has crippling depression, he really hates himself and thinks he's shit. He barely practices but can just draw fucking nearly perfect anatomy. Proportions are great, can do shading amazingly. can draw p much anything just winging it. despite having no education. Better than quite a few of my professional artist friends. But he doesn't do anything with it because he hates it so much. It's frustrating.
[19:40] <creatureellie> Lmao
[19:40] <shuuspillow> i love it when ppl do tht or better yet make public scenes for the sake of art
[19:40] <errantwitch> @Egoangell It IS a mean callout.

[19:48] <ruviz> I think you fixed the van atleast
[19:48] <chucklercheese> in critique you first say something that works well in the work, then explain what could be worked on
[19:48] <carbonic0> its not pronounced jonas, its pronounced jo-anne-ess

[19:50] <ayasecon> Modern art is shit art. I don't think that it should be considered as art...
[19:50] <ginclevertitle> Rev havent you told us 3 times
[19:50] <foxemperoradxnsp> @RevScarecrow Do you consider cooking an art?
[19:50] <meltedclowns> That sounds nice
[19:50] <meltedclowns> Does art need meaning?
[19:50] <creatureellie> @neutrino431 hmm?

[19:50] <robrobrevolution> Cooking is a science Asx
[19:51] <shuuspillow> i make art 2 appease the gods
[19:51] <ginclevertitle> Whats the difference between david lynch and modern art?
[19:51] <flametitan> Like sometimes aesthetic can overcome purpose
[19:51] <craziercaptdice> Art doesn't need meaning, as long as you can interpret a meaning from it.
[19:51] <anxiouskiwi> Time for motion sickness
[19:51] <holopleather> why cant you just make shit thats pretty
[19:51] <cpthungryspy> Enjoyment of craft? Satisfaction in making?
[19:51] <creatureellie> @neutrino431 I am confusion
[19:51] <meltedclowns> @RevScarecrow Why do you make the stuff you do then?
[19:51] <punstartracer> 99% of my art is unexplainable cause my brain is on permanent blank
[19:51] <ilovelucario> how is the cat?
[19:51] <governor_explosion> TBH, all the art I do is because I had something bothering me and I wanted to distract myself. I'm honest.
[19:51] <somerandomsatanic> Cooking can be both, Rob
[19:51] <vanitynotpride> Create art to fight boredom
[19:51] <craziercaptdice> You don't need a meaning when you start something

[20:00] <egoangell> So there's that
[20:01] <meltedclowns> It's kinda hard to defend a game about being a massmurdering teen
[20:01] <ginclevertitle> I JUST LERNED ABOUT IT REV OK;_;
[20:01] <limitofx> ... he has workers
[20:01] <grandwizardmiller> Eva started streaming as yandev right
[20:01] <craziercaptdice> @Egoangell it's volunteer work
[20:01] <modestglottis> pretty stable by weeb standards
[20:01] <limitofx> ?
[20:01] <carbonic0> sometimes teenagers need to be murdered though
[20:01] <meltedclowns> true
[20:01] <grandwizardmiller> well yeah eva is a fucking nutter
[20:01] <carbonic0> yandere sim fufills that desire without actually killing them
[20:01] <somerandomsatanic> they know
[20:01] <natalietoday> omg there's already art of rev's sculpture-class story
[20:01] <blabeep> That's the moral of most every slasher flick
[20:01] <chuggyosh> Don't forget to save
[20:01] <somerandomsatanic> Nat, omg really
[20:01] <vanitynotpride> He works really hard on that game dude, there's bag under his eyes
[20:01] <jedirule1> hes Persona 5 streams consist of him praising Ann‘s ass.
[20:01] <thestarryskye> he hasn't added the rival yet either
[20:01] <natalietoday> @SomeRandomSatanic yeah it's on twitter
[20:01] <ilovelucario> he doesn't really code well.... that's kinda why the rival is taking upwards of 8+ months
[20:02] <luka_cola> @natalietoday link?
[20:02] <chancelloroflights> I did a bit of research over the course of all this and I never heard any bad things about him that have any substantial backing to it
[20:02] <tyler81198> okay, of course yandev is crazy. that kind of game does not come from the mind of a sane man.
[20:02] <governor_explosion> What I find mindboggling is that I've seen art jobs require three years of experience for an unpaid internship, and I don't get that
[20:02] <carbonic0> to be honest, i feel like people hype up romance way too much
[20:02] <grandwizardmiller> oh yeah eva's code is all over the fucking place
[20:02] <featheredfreak> my god that toilet needs to be put into quarantine
[20:02] <creatureellie> Lmao
[20:02] <egoangell> Yandere is an anime meme, so y'know, its not that weird

[20:03] <craziercaptdice> @Egoangell yeah, you asshole
[20:03] <magicmissilepic> Rev uses donation/sub money for that too, smh
[20:03] <limitofx> yeah he uses it to pay for his life, that way he doesn't need a day job and can work on the game what the shit
[20:03] <craziercaptdice> @Egoangell stop judging him
[20:03] <ruviz> The problem is people expect every patreon penny to go into the game
[20:03] <topkekfur> Its all down to: its just a fucking game
[20:03] <tyler81198> what about the twitch trilogy
[20:03] <turduckenpie> Rev is a child killing racist. Unsubed

[20:12] <king_foom> I've seen GWAR a total of 31 times since I was 15. Three of those were without Oderus. And only one of those was really good, that was when they had the new girl (that they already fired). She added to the vocals immensely. "Blothar" just doesn't have any range.
[20:12] <carbonic0> the dinosaur band is fantastic and sounds like dragonforce
[20:12] <nokkosjumala> Hevisaurus

[20:28] <nik12787> I almost though it was the Cash 4 Gold song from South Park
[20:28] <theluigiguy> Everspace shot up to the top of my wishlist
[20:28] <boscojokey> stone crustation
[20:28] <somerandomsatanic> its a good game
[20:29] <theluigiguy> and I just bought Dead Cells too limesThump
[20:29] <furriestbluestar> Vinland
[20:29] <ez_eight> Finns = best english speakers in the world
[20:29] <jaback11> My computer can't run it sadly. feelsbadman
[20:29] <somerandomsatanic> i need to get Dead cells
[20:29] <carbonic0> what is dead cells even
[20:29] <tyler81198> i missed thaty stream, i'm guessing it's like NMS and starbound
[20:29] <sad_spaghetti> im gonna go get some sleep bye rev and chat!
[20:29] <jedirule1> Just goes to show that the Space sim genre aint dead. Its just Hello Games that is dead
[20:29] <somerandomsatanic> @Carbonic0 pc
[20:29] <robrobrevolution> That genre is so boring to me
[20:29] <nik12787> I should check out Everspace. After seeing Rev and Vinny stream the game, does look amazing
[20:29] <cuddles07> @RevScarecrow its good if you RP in it
[20:29] <sixthsun2> What Discord?
[20:29] <creatureellie> oh FUXK
[20:29] <theluigiguy> Sub discord
[20:29] <natalietoday> @SixthSun2 sub discord
[20:29] <robrobrevolution> !discord
[20:29] <moobot> If you sub to Rev on twitch you can hang out in the Sub only discord. After you subscribe go to user settings then connections and look for "Rev's Fun House"
[20:29] <deeptron> I really want to buy dead cells but i am afraid that it won't run into my potato computer
[20:29] <furriestbluestar> I hate the idea of Sub Discords
[20:29] <furginator> @ez_eight Better then english speakers from england?
[20:29] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Best Of May 2017 - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[20:29] <jahtnamas_> if this is re: rev game jam i was literally just voting in that poll
[20:30] <will99222> Is everspace good with a joystick? worth digging out my old logitech 3d pro stick?
[20:30] <ez_eight> yes, finnish english is amazing
[20:30] <carbonic0> we need to start a rev fan server on minecraft
[20:30] <kevinmunchybuttons> Wait really? Why am i not in it?
[20:30] <easy_d> finnish anything is amazing
[20:30] <furriestbluestar> Fair enough, rev. I understand completely
[20:30] <robrobrevolution> Besides the Daddy Emotes
[20:30] <kevinmunchybuttons> My twitch is connected to my discord
[20:30] <kevinmunchybuttons> at least i can daddy
[20:30] <tyler81198> i like sub channels in non-sub discords
[20:30] <will99222> LOW GEAR
[20:30] <will99222> LOW LO LOW
[20:31] <jaback11> Downshift rev
[20:31] <carbonic0> what would you mean by game jam? like creating a game or what?
[20:31] <kevinmunchybuttons> revWhyareyoulikethis revWhatiswrongwithyou Discord
[20:31] <ez_eight> hydraulic press channel is good example of finnish english
[20:31] <will99222> lower numbers = better for hills. do you drive rev?
[20:31] <drillstopsnocops> Crap... can you make cheers specific amounts by changing the number on the end? Because I think i mucked up and looked a spammer
[20:31] <luka_cola> i left the vinesauce discord because people kept breaking the no politics rule
[20:31] <craziercaptdice> @RevScarecrow if you ever get a steering wheel this game is supposedly much better with one.
[20:31] <carbonic0> oh man, sort of like joel with the doom wads?
[20:31] <theluigiguy> Yeah you can do like "cheer50"
[20:31] <cowofjustice> Would it be a Flash Game Jam? Kappa
[20:31] <tyler81198> i wanna see you do a "good flash games" stream
[20:31] <ez_eight> i have GM:S
[20:31] <carbonic0> flash game jam would be perfect

[20:32] <deeptron> Oh god i can imagine flash themed vinesauce games
[20:32] <theluigiguy> We need to build a Rev flash game

[20:32] <cowshower> shure
[20:32] <cowofjustice> Oh boy, I can't wait to make that KY brain surgery game I've always wanted to make
[20:32] <guywhoiam> I don't have the ability to MAKE games, but I do have some skills to contribute if anyone else needs me.
[20:32] <mistertbones> What is the point of this game, anyways? I've seen Funhaus play this.
[20:32] <creatureellie> I don't know how to make games but the idea is awesome
[20:32] <deeptron> I don't have any skills
[20:32] <cowshower> sure
[20:32] <ilovelucario> I thought the Friday the 13th game was fun when you streamed it, but I got so annoyed with those YouTubers who ghosted :<
[20:32] <furriestbluestar> dafuq is a egglike
[20:32] <tyler81198> i might do it sometimes, but not every time
[20:32] <ez_eight> Would you accept game mods?

[20:34] <thetoxicavenger666> The only remnant of Fantasticaneer I have now is that collab he (she?) did with Joel in the "Songs About Rev - The Suck Dickalypse" collection from years ago
[20:34] <robrobrevolution> That link is the original
[20:34] <cowshower> But I didn't have a twitch account back then

[20:36] <limitofx> then it becomes old an boring
[20:36] <furriestbluestar> I remember when in Le Fantabulous Game, it was raining Furry Diaper comics as revenge for Vinny pushing the comic out of the skybox or whatever

[20:37] <luka_cola> @Will99222 we don't need a digital homicide vinesauce game

[20:37] <meltedclowns> I would destroy all life on Earth for the chance to be motivated enough to make a game
[20:37] <tyler81198> a mod would have to vet them to make sure that they're acceptable
[20:37] <topkekfur> i can code but not games
[20:37] <robrobrevolution> We're a perfect combo kingsableye. I already have a game idea.
[20:37] <ez_eight> What if I just take pacman but put your face in it
[20:37] <meltedclowns> I can creative but cannot code worth a damn

[20:57] <furriestbluestar> COO COO
[20:57] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow pretty sure the people who spam "is this a jojo reference" never read/watch jojo fully
[20:57] <kevinmunchybuttons> But I can't prove it because now i can't find it from when i saw it this morning, maybe i dreampt the meme

[20:57] <thestridercomplex> @lord_esuba no he ment covfefe
[20:57] <zephtatoes> people used to say pony reference?
[20:57] <will99222> need a remix of that coocoo.
[20:57] <boatsnbrahs> rev do you ever eat something while paying half attention and get your moustache in your beard?
[20:57] <gnorfnorf> LMAO
[20:57] <somerandomsatanic> what if thats hoots?
[20:57] <holopleather> is that a jojo reference
[20:58] <somerandomsatanic> 🤔
[20:58] <will99222> I would have watched jojo, but the fans are so cancerous i hate it already
[20:58] <fantasmatic2> how many logs do you think rev has missed and are on the floor?
[20:58] <queenofwaffles> is that homestuck?
[20:58] <sencake> was that a jojo reference?
[20:58] <tohihroyu> What if Hooty is trying to message Rev thru the game?

[20:58] <boscojokey> @revscarecrow didnt you get death threats from the jojo fandom?
[20:58] <respeon> Rev you're funny in your own way
[20:58] <annybody> Kukkuu~
[20:58] <thetruecaptaincrunch> BibleThump
[20:58] <luka_cola> @jahtnamas_ i was watching jojo but i dropped it
[20:58] <tyler81198> i think covfefe was trump trying to type coverage
[20:58] <nscastie> revNoot OhMyDog
[20:58] <lil_jaguartv> Theres no such thing as sleep when you play games Rev.
[20:58] <boomoperater> break it or something, violent destruction can solve 47.9% of your problems
[20:58] <tohihroyu> can't you .dat mod the game? replace the coo coo with NOOT NOOT
[20:58] <vanitynotpride> Cuckoo
[20:58] <boatsnbrahs> it's cool rev, just masterbate like 3 times and you'll be able to sleep
[20:58] <elephantboyq> Cuckoo birds are amazing animals, aren't they? Kappa
[20:59] <carbonic0> i thought covfefe was rev having a stroke and trying to type coffee
[20:59] <fantasmatic2> @Tyler81198 from an helicopter Kappa ?
[20:59] <jahtnamas_> but at the same time i don't even have an earthly clue what jojo's even about but i have a lot of friends that love it (and thankfully don't spout The Meme)
[20:59] <will99222> du du, Dudu, duDudu
[20:59] <sencake> "In that not funny way" LMAOOOO
[20:59] <kengion> SO Rev how was your day?
[20:59] <kingsableye> @Tohihroyu could just replace the coo coo sound file with Noot Noot
[20:59] <lil_jaguartv> You're funny because your so clueless Rev
[20:59] <fantasmatic2> its true tho
[20:59] <kronos43> cant you just like kill someone or rob a bank for money

[20:59] <sundaysoup> hi guys
[20:59] <holopleather> masturbation is next update
[20:59] <boomoperater> just rub your hard wood
[20:59] <jahtnamas_> i love how it's just a texture
[20:59] <somerandomsatanic> hey @SundaySoup
[20:59] <fantasmatic2> looks a bit 2D
[20:59] <vanitynotpride> Solid advice
[20:59] <tohihroyu> polish that wood
[20:59] <meltedclowns> Drink the shed booze to sleep
[20:59] <bleezett> KEEP GOING
[20:59] <chrispbit> Every odd fap get's you sleepy, Every even fap get's you more adrenaline
[20:59] <lil_jaguartv> That wood is Sooo 2D
[20:59] <tyler81198> i don't watch jojo, i just really like the reference meme
[20:59] <fantasmatic2> rev only missed 2 firewoods, that's pretty good all things considered
[20:59] <rigbiie> Masturbating 3 times only gets me worked up, it actually does the opposite effect. That's horrible advice

[20:24] <zombiehunter6022> old
[20:24] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:24] <punstartracer> wew
[20:24] <maffia7> it's a fictional character anyways
[20:25] <kasigil> well its drawn as an adult woman and its all fictional in the first place
[20:25] <kasigil> who gives a fuck
[20:25] <maffia7> the main guys
[20:25] <thejzoli> lot of the porn depicts her as older tho
[20:25] <theluigiguy> yeah
[20:25] <zombiehunter6022> he's dead rip
[20:25] <goodraandgengar> whaddup chat and Rev
[20:25] <theluigiguy> hi goodraandgengar
[20:26] <zarkith> I've got dual monitors, so I can play and watch. Just don't expect wiki facts :d
[20:26] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Best Of May 2017 - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[20:26] <maffia7> REV if I'd make a fictional character based on you and people would give that fictional character an alternative identiy, would you be able to still associate yourself with that even tho it's not the original fictional character I made?
[20:26] <maffia7> sorry this is a bit philosophical
[20:26] <punstartracer> feet? Kreygasm
[20:27] <werewhiskey_> i dont get it either
[20:27] <cg_hardy> finally caught a Rev!
[20:27] <punstartracer> it's your face and stuff but it's not how you act
[20:27] <cg_hardy> I named a blue chicken after you
[20:27] <meawz> Rev your rabbit will drop a foot when its friendship is high enough
[20:27] <maffia7> like... I make it based on you, but people manipulate that you by making their version based on the fictional character...
[20:28] <asunz> Are we talking about rp here
[20:28] <theluigiguy> hi CG_Hardy
[20:28] <punstartracer> OwO
[20:28] <theluigiguy> time to roll big here Rev
[20:28] <cg_hardy> yo theluigiguy
[20:28] <thejzoli> Just swibg your axe at the rabbit and you'll get a foot Kappa
[20:28] <freyja_fenris> Hey Rev, hey chat o/
[20:28] <zombiehunter6022> limesHi
[20:28] <theluigiguy> hi Freyja freddSwag
[20:29] <punstartracer> my rev headcanon is that he is multiple revs that get made just to stream once and never to be seen again
[20:29] <freyja_fenris> Hey luigi, zombie, CG <3
[20:29] <zarkith> It's only good when you have the money to burn
[20:29] <punstartracer> so he pretends to be "talking to past rev" but he is actually just talking to revs that got hit with nostalgia
[20:30] <cg_hardy> the next update needs to make the counter clickable from the bottom
[20:30] <cg_hardy> or at least an option to turn off UI
[20:31] <cg_hardy> one cherry = x2
[20:31] <maffia7> REV honestly yes I agree now... it's fucked up
[20:31] <maffia7> but the damage is done

[20:32] <freyja_fenris> cheer215
[20:32] <punstartracer> Not over 22 over under 16 keep
[20:32] <maffia7> sure the people who did r34 of a fictional character based on a real person may not know that it is truly based on a real person, but they could have been more thoughtful and researched a little before doing it
[20:33] <theluigiguy> revBYPE
[20:33] <maffia7> revBYPE
[20:33] <punstartracer> @maffia7 i mean a quick awnser would be that rev doesn't care about all the r34 in where he fucks a bunch of randos
[20:34] <maffia7> sure...
[20:34] <thejzoli> This game is kinda rigged.
[20:34] <voidedge87> Hello Rev, thank you for streaming! Hype.
[20:34] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:34] <thejzoli> against the player that is
[20:34] <theluigiguy> "Yep, this is happening"
[20:34] <theluigiguy> wow that was bullshit
[20:34] <meawz> rng is always messed on these games
[20:35] <flametitan> @TheJzoli All games are. It's how they make money

[20:37] <thejzoli> Play against the dude in the bottom right table. Bigger bets
[20:37] <voidedge87> i know its not a thing in that game <<;
[20:37] <buffprettyriku> wew lads
[20:37] <punstartracer> @goodraandgengar if you don't mind nsfw you could read "human anatomy for artists" and "drawing for all its worth" it has good body proportions to get a grasp how hooman works
[20:38] <asunz> Figure Drawing for all its Worth
[20:38] <asunz> Andrew Loomis
[20:38] <punstartracer> yeah that's it
[20:38] <asunz> I'd suggest reading Fun with a Pencil first, though!
[20:38] <asunz> Same author, pretty fucking awesome
[20:39] <punstartracer> That reminds me of "stealing like an artist" another good book
[20:39] <theluigiguy> pretty sure it was
[20:40] <cartoonairman> Kinda like how I pick up on programming languages by messing other peoples' sources.

[20:43] <goodraandgengar> @PunStarTracer Thanks for the tip, i'll look into it!
[20:44] <eeman33> Rev are you south tejas?
[20:44] <zarkith> Dew art
[20:44] <punstartracer> "boy, i really like this furry rp, maybe ill add it to my book"
[20:44] <asunz> Speaking of inspiration (and maybe references)
[20:44] <eeman33> i hate south texas
[20:44] <maffia7> yea I like peoples art but I don't like it to a point where I idolize the artist and I want to be like that... I just do my own shit... basiclaly I do what I can and I try new things and gain new experiences
[20:44] <eeman33> its hot
[20:44] <eeman33> and humid
[20:44] <eeman33> i want to die
[20:44] <asunz> Pinterest is a really good source of references
[20:44] <theluigiguy> rip eeman
[20:44] <meawz> same here eeman :' )
[20:45] <cg_hardy> please do not fuck the art, thank you
[20:45] <flametitan> lol Rev trying to talk about furries
[20:45] <meawz> its s humid tonight
[20:45] <eeman33> like its pretty on sunny days
[20:45] <eeman33> but then you realize its sunny
[20:45] <egoangell> I want twintelle to sit on my face
[20:45] <eeman33> and the sun is a deadly lazer in south texas
[20:45] <theluigiguy> oh
[20:45] <egoangell> OFUCK WRONG CHAT
[20:45] <theluigiguy> LUL
[20:45] <maffia7> lol
[20:45] <asunz> what the fuck
[20:46] <punstartracer> my process to know how to draw was watching what did i liked about art and tried to understand what made it good
[20:46] <punstartracer> im a hoe for the color purple i guess
[20:46] <asunz> Oh yeah, its interface is SHIT
[20:46] <eeman33> wait is Stardew valley in realtime
[20:46] <von_ragnar> But what make fun of them? I mean: that's what hobbys are for: to have fun. Laughing at someones hobby is just being a jerk
[20:46] <egoangell> Pun you'll love saints row
[20:46] <eeman33> wait nvm
[20:46] <theluigiguy> No eeman
[20:46] <asunz> But there's a lot of stuff in there
[20:46] <theluigiguy> @von_ragnar agreed
[20:46] <eeman33> its 7:45 and stardew was at 7:40
[20:46] <moobot> On mobile but wanna support the channel? You can subscribe with this link! https://www.twitch.tv/products/revscarecrow/ticket New Emotes at 250 (222/250 Subscribers)
[20:47] <eeman33> so i freaked out
[20:47] <punstartracer> Last time I used pinterest there was a huge cockblock that said something like "join now"
[20:47] <zarkith> What if you use colors that don't exist vineKirb
[20:47] <theluigiguy> freddLove
[20:47] <punstartracer> covering 70% of the website
[20:47] <von_ragnar> @Egoangell I just bought franchies pack week ago... these games rock
[20:47] <crazybean42> She likes to watch you sleep.
[20:47] <asunz> There was a workaround for that...
[20:48] <von_ragnar> What if I paint with all the colors of the wind?
[20:48] <cg_hardy> I'm afraid of Kent since he did that to me
[20:48] <hootey> That was a weird sentence to walk in on.
[20:48] <zarkith> bomb the mayor
[20:48] <eeman33> i think kent is trying to send some messages
[20:48] <flametitan> Is Kent a terrorist?
[20:48] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow suddenly poltical
[20:48] <theluigiguy> Hi Hootey
[20:48] <eeman33> we need art of kent as a al quida memer
[20:48] <eeman33> memeber
[20:48] <hootey> I'm...good.
[20:48] <hootey> Are you...good?
[20:48] <maffia7> I think there is a difference between learning to cover and learning to compose basically... if you analyze what made things good in your opinion your gain frame lies in the composing part, but if you just redraw what someone you idolize drew you learn to cover well? but can you actually learn to compose from covering? if I think about music I've heard it's something complitly different for bands
[20:48] <von_ragnar> This could be worse. My wife (Maru) used to give me bombs in this game
[20:48] <maffia7> hi Hootey
[20:48] <whimsicallifestyle> Most people don't have bombs collecting dust in their houses.
[20:49] <maffia7> yes REV do it
[20:49] <hootey> You should, it's fun
[20:49] <cg_hardy> well he came back from a war
[20:49] <theluigiguy> I need to make a list first before tweeting that
[20:49] <crazybean42> @RevScarecrow Are you a native Texan from birth or did you move there? I'm asking as a native North Dakotan that is sick of his state.
[20:49] <punstartracer> ca fay
[20:49] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow rev are you still getting butt hurt jojo tweets hope they stop
[20:50] <zarkith> And he'll die in Austin
[20:50] <zarkith> And his ghost will haunt Austin
[20:50] <von_ragnar> She was like "I found this in my scrap pile, maybe you can use it". I mean: thanks, honey, but could you stop storing enough explosives to blow entire city to kingdom come in my home?
[20:50] <maffia7> I feel like my wall of text was skipped but honestly I can't blame anyone
[20:50] <maffia7> sorry for making this such a big difficult topic
[20:50] <eeman33> i heard jojo
[20:50] <eeman33> where is it
[20:50] <punstartracer> in hell
[20:50] <eeman33> oh
[20:50] <eeman33> you no like?
[20:51] <cartoonairman> I was reading it but the text scrolled too fast and I'm too lazy.
[20:51] <zombiehunter6022> @eeman33 no I'm saying how some jojo fans can't take a joke
[20:51] <eeman33> btw i would like to live in austin
[20:51] <punstartracer> im 100% about those jojo jawlines
[20:51] <eeman33> Oh
[20:51] <eeman33> lol
[20:51] <hootey> See, just write them like this, and it'll be great
[20:51] <zarkith> JawJawlines?
[20:51] <zarkith> JawJaw's Bizarre Trip to the Dentist?
[20:51] <crazybean42> I'm looking for a new state and was thinking of California but heard about high tax and how it's not that great.
[20:52] <eeman33> jojo fanboys who try and spread their opinions on it like missionaries suck
[20:52] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[20:52] <crazybean42> I also heard that Texas had good Computer Engineer job availability, that's why I asked.
[20:52] <cartoonairman> The problem is that fans have not grasped that oversaturation drives potential fans away. Exactly why I've never seen a Star Wars movie.
[20:52] <hootey> I'd love to play back that weird voice set from Icewind Dale I made from your streams, and see if you recognize anything you say
[20:52] <von_ragnar> We're all a bunch of weirdos
[20:52] <asunz> Oh no
[20:52] <maffia7> terrorist
[20:52] <crazybean42> Fuck the police, and all that.
[20:52] <maffia7> win
[20:52] <flametitan> WOW
[20:52] <zombiehunter6022> ANELE
[20:52] <meawz> rip
[20:52] <punstartracer> I've seen all of the star wars movies with memes
[20:53] <eeman33> do they have hijabs in stardew
[20:53] <hootey> Oh, when would you like to do that?
[20:53] <cg_hardy> Harvey told me cheese is unhealthy, he deserves that bombing
[20:53] <theluigiguy> 👀
[20:53] <von_ragnar> Luckily, Maru is out of work that day.
[20:53] <crazybean42> Wait, what?
[20:53] <von_ragnar> Go fish
[20:54] <hootey> I have 4 Yays by my count, so I think it should be fine to say so
[20:54] <maffia7> REV I believe I asked this already but I'm tired and my short time memory is kinda bad rn... but do you like playing fihting games? think about the new or upcoming releases like tekken 7 or ARMS... would you stream fighting games?
[20:54] <punstartracer> "I have no idea what I'm doing with myself, did I pet all the animals?" same

[20:57] <eeman33> Rev whats your fav game
[20:57] <hootey> I don't care tbh
[20:57] <hootey> Oh yeah, I can find it for you
[20:57] <tohihroyu> !uptime
[20:57] <moobot> Rev has been streaming for 37m 37s
[20:57] <maffia7> wait what?
[20:57] <maffia7> the pathfinder stream?
[20:57] <hootey> Oh, sure. I'll start setting it up
[20:58] <hootey> Psy High
[20:58] <punstartracer> ClappyHype TBTacoProps
[20:58] <maffia7> oh right
[20:58] <maffia7> you mean cyoa
[20:58] <hootey> You nailed it
[20:58] <crazybean42> @RevScarecrow Do you hear the term "pop" alot down in Texas also what kind of soda do you like?
[20:58] <azusa19> punk cheerleader
[20:58] <tohihroyu> How's Momo?
[20:58] <theluigiguy> revMomo <3
[20:59] <maffia7> somehow I thought I missed out on so much that REV made a dnd character named after his cyoa character
[20:59] <hootey> Is it called Coke regardless of what it is?
[20:59] <von_ragnar> Honestly, I never like mining in Stradew Valley. Prefer fishing. Don't know why people say it's hard
[20:59] <eeman33> yeah people say coke alot
[20:59] <cmdr_scruff> Sprite is coke. Coke is coke
[20:59] <crazybean42> @RevScarecrow No I was asking you about that, up here in the north we call it soda or pop, not really Coke unless it actually is Coca-Cola.
[20:59] <tohihroyu> Cats can make it up to 30 years
[20:59] <prob_rob> is water, coke?
[20:59] <maffia7> 7up?
[20:59] <hootey> That is weird
[21:00] <asunz> Sprite is a special snowflake
[21:00] <dagothorsim> It's funny because that would mean pepsi is coke
[21:00] <eeman33> sprite is 7up and sierra mist
[21:00] <cmdr_scruff> Dr Pepper is Dr Pepper!
[21:00] <punstartracer> anything black is coke?
[21:00] <prob_rob> "I'll have a coke" "Cool, what do you want?" "Bottled water"
[21:00] <meawz> everythings coke if you try hard enough
[21:00] <maffia7> sprite =/= 7up
[21:00] <tohihroyu> what about root beer?
[21:00] <maffia7> no 7up is the uncola dude
[21:00] <moobot> Wanna have your fan art shown on stream? Post it here https://booru.vineshroom.net/post/list and Rev will show it at the end of the stream. Make sure to put "rev" tag so he can find it.
[21:00] <flametitan> Apparently RC Cola will not make a covfefe flavoured drink
[21:00] <von_ragnar> What abou orange-flavoured drinks?
[21:00] <mushroom_qui> cream soda
[21:00] <maffia7> is a bottle of soda a hotdog
[21:00] <maffia7> or a taco
[21:00] <punstartracer> cream soda is trash
[21:00] <von_ragnar> Mirinda, Fanta?
[21:00] <prob_rob> Is chocolate milkshake, a coke?
[21:01] <crazybean42> Is Mountain Dew soup?
[21:01] <theluigiguy> LUL
[21:01] <whimsicallifestyle> It's a broth.
[21:01] <eeman33> mountain dew is mountain frost
[21:01] <maffia7> is milk water or a sandwich?
[21:01] <dagothorsim> @Crazybean42 It's not soup until you put doritos in it
[21:01] <theluigiguy> Milk is a taco

[21:27] <greenkakapo> i agree. we need make the planet warmer so the oceans turn sterile. then we can swim in it without worrying about being eaten

[21:38] <pancakemisery> Rev, why are you like this?
[21:38] <x3shadow50> fidget spinners are idiotic
[21:38] <coolcapybara> @RevScarecrow Sexual Lobster is a YouTube animator who makes random videos, some with a manwhore named Fernando, others loosely based on obscure comics.
[21:38] <androidpriest> they sell em at five below
[21:39] <magezian> 5 bucks? that's too much taterThink
[21:39] <flametitan> Why are Fidget spinners are a meme?
[21:39] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow i saw kids selling fidget spinners at a booth, like you'd sell lemonade.
[21:39] <deblod100> Buy a fidget cube instead.
[21:39] <automaticmanic> Fidget spinner tricks
[21:39] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow I found a bootleg 8 sided fidget cube
[21:39] <omninulla> they are just the silly bands of this generation
[21:39] <skelekorgi> Agreed, I didn't get much out of fidget spinners
[21:39] <paladinofchaos33> Have you tried a fidget-sphere?
[21:39] <dondoran85> what are you doing, Rev?
[21:39] <deblod100> They have fidget cubes also.
[21:39] <glassbrain> You should try a yo-yo
[21:39] <queenofwaffles> ME TOO when i was young i had those tangle fidget toys
[21:39] <someblueguyinchat> @RevScarecrow Apparently, the cube is made of subpar material, so you should find something else
[21:39] <papanade69> I dont understand it at all. And I have far worse than ADD

[21:39] <absolutelybroken> I saw a fucking expensive fidget spinner shaped like a cube the other day.
[21:39] <docjackal2> @RevScarecrow Fidget cubes help me way better than spinners.
[21:39] <x3shadow50> did it have little orange boopers with faces on it @Nick2424Delcat
[21:39] <flametitan> @Nick2424Delcat How can you be an 8 sided CUBE?

[21:57] <specturtle> i used to stick my fingers into those teeth holes
[21:57] <magezian> @theluigiguy I think it's by the choice of colors, and the amount and size of the strokes
[21:57] <absolutelybroken> people don't remember tapes? jesus

[21:57] <flametitan> TAPES WERE OK AT FIRST
[21:57] <adam_smif> @theluigiguy I know very little about programing, but I image it's based off how many colors and what colors being used. Hence why usually the complains from customers is "why is it so bland" or "it's too bright"
[21:58] <mithos56> They weren't perfect, but there are tapes that have really high fidelity

[20:11] <pk_chaos> tuesgayz

[20:11] <theluigiguy> Yes tomorrow is Sunday
[20:11] <certainlydane> there was this concert in Copenhagen with a sorta heavy thing but they had 5 seconds of summer as a starting act
[20:11] <jokeemperor> @queenofwaffles dont
[20:12] <loungearound_> rev i'm going to make a hipster band called Hotdog Sandwich
[20:12] <moobot> Wanna have your fan art shown on stream? Post it here https://booru.vineshroom.net/post/list and Rev will show it at the end of the stream. Make sure to put "rev" tag so he can find it.
[20:12] <zerklord48> ha i'm your best friend ha line from the game
[20:12] <zombiehunter6022> @RevScarecrow undertale is fine but some parts of the fanbase are..."special"
[20:12] <queenofwaffles> tf is that cat doing
[20:13] <zerklord48> oh yeah
[20:13] <egoangell> @revscarecrow did you see the new twitch tv series syndication is thr old mst3d series?
[20:13] <stupify3456> @zombiehunter6022 same with any popular game
[20:13] <theluigiguy> revMomo
[20:13] <robrobrevolution> Hey I love "job" job
[20:13] <natalietoday> "job"
[20:13] <certainlydane> doesnt that go for every fanbase? @zombiehunter6022
[20:13] <boodysnagglers> where do you work?
[20:13] <queenofwaffles> the game cat lol
[20:13] <theluigiguy> Oh boy! I love [insert job here]
[20:13] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow do you wanna work 6 to 2?
[20:13] <arvinthefarmer> i must admit am very behind in the stardew valley
[20:13] <powerslashmomiji> I'm waiting to get checked put by a sleep doctor because I'm fairly certain I have some kind of disorder that makes job jobs impossible for me
[20:13] <natalietoday> I sure do love [JOB]
[20:14] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow I inject itinto my eyes
[20:14] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[20:14] <stupify3456> @nick2424delcat I do. Leaves the rest of the day to do whatever.
[20:14] <theluigiguy> Do not inject things into your eyes
[20:14] <muncho2> I do 14 days on 7 days off. 12 hour days. Shit blows but 7 days off in a row is awesome
[20:14] <zombiehunter6022> @CertainlyDane @stupify3456 pretty much but "that" part of undertale fanbase is overshadowing the rest
[20:14] <egoangell> revCoffee
[20:14] <arvinthefarmer> honestly I really like rev's monotone
[20:14] <loungearound_> i wish i had that, muncho
[20:14] <arisunz> You'd be closer if you had chosen the double geode thing
[20:15] <natalietoday> you also gotta dig worms, Reverino
[20:15] <theluigiguy> Make friends
[20:15] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow you can let me call you daddy and be happy about it
[20:15] <stupify3456> @zombiehunter6022 gotta love the vocal minority.
[20:15] <zombiehunter6022> @RevScarecrow stalker?
[20:15] <theluigiguy> Or try looking for rare fish
[20:15] <bluesagne> what is the point of the game?
[20:15] <cartoonairman> Be normal, masturbate all day.
[20:15] <camstonisland> My reccomendation is to spontaniously combust
[20:15] <loungearound_> @RevScarecrow you could just play guitar for like 8 hours.
[20:15] <camstonisland> can you do that rev
[20:15] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:15] <loungearound_> on stream
[20:15] <secondbutthole> @RevScarecrow im so glad you're streaming. i've fallen into a very sudden deep depression and im just crying so at least i know you can cheer me up a bit
[20:15] <arvinthefarmer> what about streaming psx games
[20:15] <hexspin> Rev did people wish you a happy father's day on tumblr
[20:16] <secondbutthole> in other words i guess, thanks for streaming
[20:16] <theluigiguy> @secondbutthole Feel better soon revMomo <3 hope the stream helps
[20:16] <zerklord48> yep the fan bass is kinda... yeahhhh
[20:16] <ellie_eyegore> which is odd because that's especially missing the point of the game as I understand it
[20:16] <medaanon> eh it has its problems
[20:16] <jokeemperor> I want a week of magic but work
[20:16] <zerklord48> nope that fandom
[20:16] <zombiehunter6022> @RevScarecrow like "that" part of the jojo fanbase
[20:16] <theluigiguy> fantastic username
[20:16] <alovingmemberofchat> I don't think undertale is at all unique with its bad fanbase tbh. I think it's just noticable because it ccame out of nowhere
[20:16] <queenofwaffles> 2nd buthole aka bussy
[20:16] <loungearound_> undertale has a bad fanbase much like fnaf
[20:16] <queennati> Yeah I was active in the Undertale fandom for a while, I luckily left it before it went crazy enough to put needles in a fanartist's cookies...
[20:16] <zerklord48> ha @zombiehunter6022 MUDA MUDA MUDA
[20:16] <certainlydane> i have a friend who doesnt like undertale for the cosplayers but any other game and comic cosplay is amazing
[20:16] <x3shadow50> HELLO FATHER MULLIN
[20:17] <theluigiguy> Mike is the expert on bussy
[20:17] <secondbutthole> it's based on a character that had a hole in his chest because of a unicorn. chussy, if you will
[20:17] <x3shadow50> HELLO CHAT
[20:17] <natalietoday> revussy
[20:17] <zombiehunter6022> @Zerklord48 WRYYY
[20:17] <theluigiguy> hi x3shadow50
[20:17] <loungearound_> @RevScarecrow it's pronounced "Boosy"
[20:17] <cpthungryspy> Nat no!
[20:17] <egoangell> Pwease no steppy
[20:17] <nick2424delcat> What about the clussy
[20:17] <arvinthefarmer> (let it be noted am very quiet when am sober)
[20:17] <theluigiguy> Nat do not bring up my sins
[20:17] <zerklord48> oh yeah my man
[20:17] <boodysnagglers> @revscarecrow I have successfully avoided Undertale hype and the fannase, so I played it just recently, and it was pretty good. so idk how the fanbase is
[20:17] <cartoonairman> What I dislike the most is how flanderized the fanbase has made Sans.
[20:17] <natalietoday> @theluigiguy :eyes:
[20:17] <queenofwaffles> gary bussy
[20:17] <theluigiguy> 👌

[20:18] <harrisboe> That's not even a meme. It's common sense
[20:18] <fiddox> Yeah memes are slowly turning into neo dada.
[20:18] <egoangell> TELL THE STORY
[20:18] <zerklord48> oh we should make a religion out of this
[20:18] <queenofwaffles> i just found out about buenos dias yesterday
[20:18] <alovingmemberofchat> internet memes have gone to shit more and more since memes started being ABOUT internet memes
[20:18] <theluigiguy> oh no...
[20:18] <theluigiguy> I've looked it up
[20:18] <zerklord48> oh
[20:18] <zombiehunter6022> dont forget porn on tumblr
[20:18] <loungearound_> i dont goto tumblr because i don't need any more reasons to NOT want to live on this planet.
[20:18] <natalietoday> im scare
[20:18] <zangooseoo> @RevScarecrow but are they real neo nazis or ironic neo nazis
[20:18] <certainlydane> oh and same friend loves memes but hates dank memes and there is no talking sense into him

[20:25] <cartoonairman> Survival of the fittest.
[20:25] <x3shadow50> YEs you can.
[20:25] <zerklord48> HA
[20:25] <harrisboe> No, the kids room is pointless Kappa
[20:25] <theluigiguy> Can we construct offspring with my significant other?
[20:25] <hexspin> Mold them out of clay Kappa
[20:25] <ellie_eyegore> yes and you can get rid of them ^^
[20:25] <queenofwaffles> can you make test tube babies

[20:27] <natalietoday> hi shug
[20:27] <shugarshock> Hi hinat
[20:27] <groundman> There's no really winning or losing
[20:27] <jokeemperor> I never played this game
[20:27] <x3shadow50> your spouse has a 0.05% chance of asking you if you want to have a child once you get the nursery done. They are strangely immortal and never grow past being toddlers, as if they are gods and require sacrifice to grow.
[20:27] <shugarshock> There is no beating the game
[20:27] <certainlydane> easy answer you dont
[20:27] <arisunz> @Shugarshock you're gonna have fun at certain hell-like part of the game
[20:28] <theluigiguy> You don't beat the game, the game beats you
[20:28] <shugarshock> I have two children with Abigail my rock eating wife
[20:28] <groundman> Unlike Harvest Moon, which has an endstate, Stardew Valley basically gos until you're done
[20:28] <theluigiguy> limesLove
[20:28] <cathidor> how'd you open up that cave by the train station
[20:28] <shugarshock> @arisunz did you mean ALL
[20:28] <pommeline> it depends on the harvest moon. a lot of harvest moons go endlessly now
[20:28] <harrisboe> I thought standee valley only lasted three in-game years
[20:28] <arisunz> @Shugarshock Oh boy Kappa
[20:28] <cathidor> ah, alrighty then

[20:39] <muncho2> Kappa
[20:39] <egoangell> @natalietoday he explaining kamgaroo
[20:39] <overdosedelusion> I understand completely. DansGame
[20:39] <theluigiguy> Self driving cars vs Kangaroos
[20:39] <theluigiguy> context
[20:39] <loungearound_> that's not yellow @RevScarecrow
[20:39] <pancakemisery> revMomo I REQUIRE THE LINE MORTAL
[20:39] <muncho2> LUL
[20:39] <theluigiguy> Imagine... kangaroos
[20:39] <natalietoday> that's... not much context
[20:39] <queenofwaffles> this looks like a sacrificial altar
[20:39] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Passpartout - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[20:39] <zangooseoo> self driving car vs 1000 degree glowing hot fidget kangaroo
[20:39] <queenofwaffles> sacrifice the kangaroo
[20:39] <fandangolate> VAN GOGH
[20:39] <luka_cola> you forgot the upside down dick
[20:39] <muncho2> Rayman Kangaroo ????
[20:40] <theluigiguy> Context is that self driving car navigation gets fucked by kangaroo movement
[20:40] <queennati> @pancakemisery ok I'll try, thank you
[20:40] <cartoonairman> That's not a kangaroo, it's a giant mouse.
[20:40] <theluigiguy> limesHmm
[20:40] <isghj> can you give it boxing gloves?
[20:40] <ellie_eyegore> is this how Lightning McQueen dies?
[20:40] <theluigiguy> yes Ellie
[20:40] <vineheart> oooh i see
[20:40] <muncho2> So the car is seeing 400 foot roos in the distance?
[20:41] <zangooseoo> kangaroo-zilla
[20:41] <arisunz> So, shitty depth sensors?
[20:41] <ithinkiplaygames> Use shadows.
[20:41] <vineheart> yes ari
[20:41] <theluigiguy> Yeah just bad depth sensing
[20:41] <overdosedelusion> So ban kangaroos from Australia.
[20:41] <theluigiguy> shadows are unreliable
[20:41] <cartoonairman> Wow, so a new technology has flaws. Wow.
[20:41] <breezywave> what is happening here
[20:41] <tonichu> You got point
[20:41] <zombiehunter6022> @RevScarecrow you need to change the ticker rev
[20:41] <jaketheshrimp> Isn't that just mirror illusions?
[20:41] <mangosingularity> I think the obvious solution to this problem is to just remove kangaroos
[20:41] <egoangell> Time of day, right? @theluigiguy
[20:41] <overdosedelusion> Problem solved. A better future.
[20:41] <theluigiguy> indeed
[20:41] <harrisboe> So give the cars a second camera for depth perception
[20:41] <therealatompunk> The thought of a robot brain being exasperated at a moving kangaroo is for some reason hilarious to me
[20:41] <muncho2> roos all up in yo grill
[20:42] <loungearound_> eldritch dimensional-shifting kangaroos
[20:42] <ithinkiplaygames> OK, solution: Massive walls around roads, zap any animals on roads.
[20:42] <tonichu> but why theres two potatoes with strings on the road and how big are they
[20:42] <loungearound_> i'm ok with this @Ithinkiplaygames
[20:42] <ellie_eyegore> that's pretty amazing to realize how difficult it must be to program something to recognize how objects move in space
[20:42] <loungearound_> no normal earth kangaroos dont fucking jump
[20:42] <cartoonairman> What if we just sink Australia?
[20:42] <arvinthefarmer> why are kangaroos a problem in texas?
[20:42] <loungearound_> those jumpin cunts are from some eldritch horror
[20:43] <penescosapo> non-euclidean kangaroos
[20:43] <medievalfreakyfriday> Have you read "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream", Rev?
[20:43] <loungearound_> boars are a problem in texas #truth
[20:43] <theluigiguy> Become the kangaroo
[20:43] <kilil00> Eradicate kangaroo
[20:43] <therealatompunk> Kangaroos really like to drown smaller animals and people
[20:43] <tonichu> pleace dont Australian master chef is the best one
[20:43] <saggitori> the most problems with learning algorithms is the requirement of a metric fuck ton of data.
[20:43] <luka_cola> now that i think about it i've never seen a kangaroo either
[20:43] <x3shadow50> I am going the Rev way, corndogs for dinner revDay
[20:43] <ithinkiplaygames> Use a big cookie cutter, move Sydney to Hawaii
[20:43] <tohihroyu> How deep can you go in mines in this game?
[20:44] <nik12787> There was a game based on I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream
[20:44] <medievalfreakyfriday> It's an interesting interpretation on your whole self learning technology thing. I'd recommend it. It's only like a 14 page short story
[20:44] <ellie_eyegore> and that neuronet must be A.M. because it hates good content Kappa
[20:44] <pommeline> skull cavern is endless afaik
[20:44] <arvinthefarmer> have you read/listened to "there will be soft rains"
[20:44] <pancakemisery> everything is neural nets in the end, tho technically something like Apriori, and that shit is really really hard to code
[20:44] <spleenyo> ArmL vineHard ArmR
[20:44] <overdosedelusion> Isn't YouTube's neuronet responsible for those Hey Kids videos?
[20:44] <isghj> youtube recommendations is neural isn't it
[20:44] <luka_cola> @OverdoseDelusion oh god don't remind me of the jojo nursery rhymes
[20:44] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[20:45] <cartoonairman> So youtube actually thinks I'm interested in Racist Mario?
[20:45] <tonichu> rev when my sumer car stream again
[20:45] <ellie_eyegore> FailFish
[20:45] <ithinkiplaygames> Dang Dunning-Kruger effect, I've seen like 4 mentions of I Have No Mouth today
[20:45] <x3shadow50> yeah they fucked up the algorithim so bad not one person knows it.
[20:45] <theluigiguy> I just have a bunch of pet videos on my recommendations
[20:45] <egoangell> @revscarecrow have u seen leeory jenkens's youtube channel is now one of those live action flash game channels?
[20:45] <isghj> youtube has interaface and fanbase issues though, those aren't AI
[20:45] <theluigiguy> what Egoangell
[20:45] <namelessrumia> YouTube is apart of Google tho
[20:46] <luka_cola> youtube thinks i'm actually interested in internet politics
[20:46] <tohihroyu> I have loads of animal live streams in my recs
[20:46] <vineheart> Has rev checked his basement yet? i keep zoning out :(
[20:46] <egoangell> @theluigiguy go look for it
[20:46] <arisunz> I'm actually quite happy with my youtube recommendations...
[20:46] <mochamokat> next house upgrade.
[20:46] <hexspin> PogChamp
[20:46] <ellie_eyegore> maybe that deep dream thing can make live action flash that all looks like eldtrich dogs

[20:50] <thefoolsrest> Hello Rev
[20:50] <harrisboe> I'd play dnd but that would require friends
[20:50] <real_marshmallow_fox> hey Rev, meeting you guys on Saturday was super awesome. Everybody there was nice, and I didn't even want to punch people for my first con

[20:52] <kilil00> it's like sonic with a beatemup
[20:52] <theluigiguy> You have to turn on Twitch notifications for each streamer specifically
[20:52] <cartoonairman> I think it's a Sonic fangame that got Sega's blessing.
[20:52] <moobot> Currently streaming Rev Stardew Valley #vinesauce twitch.tv/revscarecrow
[20:52] <real_marshmallow_fox> on the subject of links, I got to tell my friends how I got autobanned from this channel for posting a link before!
[20:52] <zangooseoo> @RevScarecrow it's a very sonic styled game made using non infringerino characters and plot, sonic fans seem to love it, i thought it was pretty ok as someone who isnt a fan of 2d sonic
[20:52] <x3shadow50> hello rev face
[20:52] <harrisboe> CUT
[20:52] <arvinthefarmer> looks nice

[20:53] <tohihroyu> I only get notifications from Fred though i'm subbed/follow Vinny, you, Joel & Jen
[20:53] <luka_cola> isn't joel the most metal though?
[20:53] <arvinthefarmer> deffo
[20:53] <x3shadow50> when I turn 16 I'm gonna buy a kutte and put video game badges instead of metal badges
[20:53] <sanschoices> your camera thought your room was a rave or something?
[20:53] <arvinthefarmer> deffo 60 fps maybe bordering on 120
[20:54] <medievalfreakyfriday> Hey Rev, did you decide if you're gonna go hang out outside RTX next week?
[20:54] <meaty_refrigerator37> i am back yall
[20:54] <harrisboe> Your camera thought you were a kangaroo
[20:54] <nik12787> I have a LED desk lamp I got for $5 which also has a USB port on it to charge stuff via USB. Worth it

[20:56] <harrisboe> Beautiful
[20:56] <theluigiguy> good meme
[20:56] <x3shadow50> I've heard they are usually just assholes and just ask for commissions or won't answer questions. Plus they usually don't advertise their Con work and instead their 5 hour work.
[20:56] <real_marshmallow_fox> oh that dog's face. Its like it was crossbred with the tibetan fox
[20:56] <meaty_refrigerator37> look out youre going to get spooped rev
[20:56] <meaty_refrigerator37> spooper killed
[20:56] <medievalfreakyfriday> rev you gotta by a big bomb and blow the stone up
[20:57] <arvinthefarmer> meh
[20:57] <secondbutthole> don't worry- when i went to the con, i didnt feel up for buying much from the art alley- nothing really stood out to me
[20:57] <arvinthefarmer> dnt worry
[20:57] <theluigiguy> Lots of variety at the TMG booths
[20:57] <ellie_eyegore> the con I went to in May was that way Rev, very few artists that stood out to me
[20:57] <real_marshmallow_fox> oh Rev, my mistake, the place is Pougkeepsie is called Dragon's Den, not Lair; I just looked it up
[20:58] <x3shadow50> I'm in kansas currently so basically all bus the KS comicon is super bloody expensive
[20:58] <arvinthefarmer> fun fact my parents own a art shop
[20:58] <arvinthefarmer> nice man
[20:58] <real_marshmallow_fox> I was really looking at those 3d pictography things at TMG. Vinny bought the Metroid one. I was looking for a Star Fox one but didn't see one

[21:07] <x3shadow50> I remember back in the day when you could say "dafuq" on roblox.
[21:07] <vineheart> Did you give a gem berry to the statue in the secret forest @RevScarecrow ?

[21:18] <alovingmemberofchat> Hey @RevScarecrow, this is Litten-Hat Chick's fiancé. (we met for like 15 seconds at TMG.) Been meaning to subscribe for ages, just now getting around to doing it. After some bad Real Life Stuff®, watching and listening to your streams has been a good way to... "decompress"? Words are difficult. Anyway, just saying thanks I guess

[21:20] <luka_cola> so new vegas is fine?
[21:20] <natalietoday> @creatureellie limesLove
[21:20] <luka_cola> nvm
[21:20] <dondoran85> @creatureellie we are pretty much the best limesLove
[21:20] <alovingmemberofchat> I love Fallout New Vegas, make mods for it... and yeah I have a VR-ready computer (TM) and it barely runs on this shit. even FO4 runs better
[21:20] <creatureellie> Nat <2
[21:20] <x3shadow50> i am incredibly frustrated with this one piece , which is a joke on how Rev's character survives the motorcycle in MSC, he stands up after doing his "sick tricks" stunt and half his face is gone? I've tried 3 times and i just can't seem to get it right.
[21:20] <lazerswordrad> Oh my god okay automod.
[21:20] <tonichu> falout new vegas might have problems but if you could remove a game from the world i would pick something like cdi zelda
[21:20] <queennati> well that's a matter of taste, they're my fav games because I love wasteland stuff.
[21:20] <lazerswordrad> GET OUT MY HEAD
[21:20] <creatureellie> I need sleep <3 **
[21:20] <kilil00> MONEH
[21:20] <theadamantarchvile> I'll give you this, Fallout 3 sucks. New Vegas is a way better game
[21:21] <namelessrumia> john cena
[21:21] <zooobr> If a game is fun its good nuff said
[21:21] <dondoran85> New Vegas is great
[21:21] <zangooseoo> @RevScarecrow maybe they're trying to make skyrim into the new doom
[21:21] <zombiehunter6022> @RevScarecrow i suggest getting project Nevada mod fir NV
[21:21] <creatureellie> @dondoran85 I agree its true
[21:21] <psudopod> spoopy eve
[21:21] <theadamantarchvile> The engine's crap and not tested nearly enough but New Vegas is still a good game
[21:21] <egoangell> @revscarecrow RE4 was released more tho
[21:21] <egoangell> Than skyrim
[21:21] <raspherbel> I get what you're saying. I think a good way to differentiate it is a bad game vs a badly made game
[21:21] <spcbrightstreak> i didnt like 4 i hate the plot, the fact everything you do is pretty much the wrong choice and that missions dont ever end
[21:21] <meaty_refrigerator37> doom vs fallout: doom is actually good
[21:21] <j1211m> Get your costume rev!!
[21:21] <cartoonairman> I once got stuck on a pile of rocks in 3. Couldn't open the menu because it thought I was in the air. Had to stack ammo boxes to escape.
[21:21] <creatureellie> spooooooks
[21:21] <modsu> my little sister fucking loves skyrim, even though for no reason the game has entire textures fucking vanish at random
[21:21] <luka_cola> the WHOM
[21:21] <egoangell> ZEEBO
[21:21] <namelessrumia> zeebo
[21:21] <makorelfish> If you want to understand why people like Fallout you kind of need to play Fallout 1 and 2
[21:22] <x3shadow50> Bethesda should have named skyrim vr, "The Elder Scrolls VR: Skyrim" because it's like V the roman numeral
[21:22] <meaty_refrigerator37> guzumbo
[21:22] <modsu> the peepo ?
[21:22] <makorelfish> Fallout 2 is also a buggy mess but it's a different sort of buggy mess
[21:22] <theadamantarchvile> Meanwhile Doom's been ported to anything that's got a decent processor
[21:22] <natalietoday> alright i gotta head out, later @revscarecrow and chat! ❤️
[21:22] <x3shadow50> gazeebo
[21:22] <j1211m> I don't know man I downloaded the vigilant mod for skyrim... Actually really fucking good
[21:22] <zangooseoo> the fuck's a zeebo?
[21:22] <tonichu> One guy said that his xbox deleted all his falout saves
[21:22] <theluigiguy> Seeya Nat KonCha
[21:22] <x3shadow50> Bye Natalie!
[21:22] <creatureellie> Bye nat, thanks again <3
[21:22] <theadamantarchvile> Like there are people who've gotten it working on a fucking ATM
[21:22] <luka_cola> i just googled it and it's fucking real
[21:22] <meaty_refrigerator37> doom is on ti 83's
[21:22] <modsu> the peepo.... theres peas in there
[21:22] <luka_cola> @theluigiguy may i post a link?
[21:22] <zangooseoo> @meaty_refrigerator37 doom is on printers
[21:22] <ellie_eyegore> @TheAdamantArchvile that's hilarious

[21:23] <cartoonairman> >Boomerang controller. What?
[21:23] <x3shadow50> even the console skyrim freezes sometimes
[21:23] <x3shadow50> it's shit
[21:24] <kilil00> Fapberry
[21:24] <raspherbel> @RevScarecrow It's like a game being bad versus a game being badly made
[21:24] <egoangell> @cartoonairman you havent seen the ps3 bananarang?
[21:24] <zangooseoo> @RevScarecrow just start taking donations to fund counterstrike gambling Kappa
[21:24] <tonichu> there was a guy who couldnt stop following me in oblivion so i had to remove him with console commands lol
[21:24] <arvinthefarmer> what about vinesauce csgo vs another team
[21:24] <modsu> console skyrim buttfucks you like you wouldn't believe
[21:24] <theadamantarchvile> Go mining?
[21:24] <alovingmemberofchat> Fallout New Vegas was released in 2009 or 2010, performs (for me) incredibly worse than FO3 which is on the same engine. I love the game but it took until I had a GTX 970 until I could run the stupid thing at a consistent framerate
[21:24] <spcbrightstreak> play more games
[21:24] <dondoran85> Halloween is tomorrow?
[21:24] <theluigiguy> in game
[21:24] <egoangell> Fred played csgo
[21:24] <kilil00> Joel plays Csgo?
[21:24] <queenofwaffles> vinesauce needs more RP
[21:25] <cartoonairman> Fun fact: Quest 64 is more stable than Bethesda games.
[21:25] <egoangell> Drunk cago vid
[21:25] <theluigiguy> Joel does play CS GO
[21:25] <arvinthefarmer> there was a old video were he did
[21:25] <x3shadow50> halloween and Rev's birthday are everyday
[21:25] <psudopod> halloween is god's gift to candy
[21:25] <garbagecanjones> Speaking of skyrim when do you plan on doing that next though you don't like to set dates
[21:25] <theluigiguy> and Fred was featured in a hilarious CS GO vid
[21:25] <zangooseoo> i sexually identify as halloween
[21:25] <medamaudee> The music in this game is always so lovely
[21:25] <creatureellie> I mean time doesn't exist Kappa
[21:25] <queenofwaffles> its july you animals
[21:25] <j1211m> @revscarecrow did you ever do the house murder quest in oblivion where if you use just a bow no one knows it's you.
[21:25] <tonichu> Also in new vegas, theres a bench if you sit on it yi cant get up because the wall blocks you so if you havent saved you are screwd there
[21:25] <egoangell> Gear?

[21:26] <kilil00> twitchRaid
[21:26] <psudopod> those fuzz things are very spirited away
[21:26] <theadamantarchvile> I remember the trick to the gates were just making a bunch of fire resistance potions and just walking to the main tower
[21:26] <tonichu> there was supposed to be oblivion for psp
[21:26] <modsu> o fuck its the shadow realm
[21:27] <tohihroyu> Is that miasma?
[21:27] <creatureellie> Soot sprites ouo
[21:27] <egoangell> @tonichu vin streamed that
[21:27] <theadamantarchvile> Oh Rev, what year are you on?
[21:27] <psudopod> yes
[21:27] <creatureellie> Majora's Mask <3
[21:27] <egoangell> I feel about NV how rev does about pblivion
[21:27] <kilil00> HOOOO
[21:27] <creatureellie> My favourite
[21:27] <dondoran85> MM is probably my favorite Zelda... maybe WW
[21:27] <egoangell> @revscarecrow ever think about streaming another game jam?
[21:28] <modsu> rev is wise he knows these things
[21:28] <psudopod> Rev, what is on the shopping list, what has brought you to the mines?
[21:28] <theadamantarchvile> Oh Rev, since they're on sale, want me to get you Fallout 1 and 2?
[21:28] <j1211m> @revscarecrow also npc dialogue in that game... Where they have Tourette syndrome to the point where they can't talk to each other straight
[21:28] <zangooseoo> i once tried to play counterstrike. i played with bots for a little bit to get used to it, found them to be really, really stupid. then i went online and within a couple minutes it was a fest of rageful screaming so i just closed the game and never went back
[21:28] <arvinthefarmer> rev how do you like your eggs in the morning
[21:28] <creatureellie> Clock town theme gives me nostalgia
[21:28] <blackcorvo> hello Revsauce
[21:28] <luka_cola> unpopular opinion: i can't play majora's mask because the time limit makes me anxious
[21:28] <creatureellie> No idea why
[21:28] <egoangell> Oh?
[21:28] <zangooseoo> @Luka_Cola that's one of the reasons i've avoided it
[21:28] <muncho2> its really rare for a game and its direct sequel to be equally amazing
[21:28] <egoangell> @luka_cola theres songs to slow the time
[21:28] <modsu> don't play by the rules
[21:28] <kilil00> OSsloth
[21:28] <creatureellie> Toasted taco?
[21:28] <modsu> i respect that
[21:28] <creatureellie> Or as it comes

[21:29] <creatureellie> Embrace it
[21:29] <lavenderkitten> @Psudopod ketchup with eggs is nasty
[21:29] <dondoran85> pop tarts are just pastries
[21:29] <dondoran85> pastries are already filled, REV
[21:29] <queenofwaffles> poptarts are donuts
[21:29] <psudopod> @LavenderKitten fyte me url
[21:29] <kilil00> rofl
[21:29] <luka_cola> @RevScarecrow are poptarts sandwiches?
[21:29] <j1211m> Poptarts are pastry dumplings
[21:29] <creatureellie> I'll always believe that lasagna is just cake
[21:29] <gator_8> You can not be both a pastry and a dumpling. It's hogwash.
[21:29] <j1211m> Case closed
[21:29] <zk_nails> poptarts are cookies
[21:29] <creatureellie> Savoury cake
[21:29] <arvinthefarmer> thnx on the sub

[21:30] <normankk> ...why does dwarf sounds like Jar Jar in my head when I read that text
[21:30] <raspherbel> @RevScarecrow I think a problem of saying "objectively bad" to mean has measurable flaws is that it kinda makes you sound like a bit of a pretentious asshole. It's like, it someone's calling a game "objectively bad" the first thing that comes to mind is that they're saying they disliked it so much that they think there's no way anyone could find it enjoyable
[21:30] <creatureellie> rev5 revDay
[21:30] <zangooseoo> @RevScarecrow you should open up a diner

[21:30] <egoangell> @raspherbel sonic o6 is objectively bad but I love it
[21:30] <glassbrain> I mean, sometimes you have to admit that there was poor worksmanship put into something.
[21:30] <arvinthefarmer> tbh am very lazy when it comes to breakfast like too lazy to make cereal
