[20:41] <guy_of_wonder> sugar is cancer for pizza
[20:41] <faldenvi> Just put some chocolate in there while you're at it
[20:41] <tricksterjuju> Making some secret sauce
[20:41] <jeddostotle7> @RevScarecrow In canon, the Minions actually didn't serve Mussolini. After serving Napoleon in the 1810s, they //conveniently// went away to the Arctic, and didn't come back until 1969.

[20:41] <imashaark> its a stick blender i think?
[20:41] <retronus_flashback> jand blender
[20:41] <queenhastur> it's a mixer
[20:41] <pwamber> True Italian pizza (and pasta) tend to have a little bit of sauce and a lotta bit of cheese.
[20:41] <creatureellie> Just add sweets as toppings
[20:41] <swinabc> @RevScarecrow Im a chef so yes you put Sugar into anything tomato based
[20:41] <punstartracer> cheese in the sauce? what
[20:41] <maniko_101> It's like people in the south or just black people we got to seasons our food we can just add salt or pepper

[20:42] <ohsnapitscheezers> I thought that was a copypasta
[20:42] <thedwarfdragon> But they helped Napoleon.
[20:42] <creatureellie> That sauce looks good
[20:42] <jeddostotle7> They ////conveniently//// didn't have to serve Hitler
[20:42] <somerandomsatanic> Sure Kappa
[20:42] <prinnydoodman> it was obviously so they wouldn't have to put hitler in the movie
[20:42] <maniko_101> This is to much....

[20:42] <regigigity> Minions served Niro and Xerxes
[20:42] <punstartracer> @mushroom_qui headcanon
[20:43] <spicyskeletor> hitler was a minion
