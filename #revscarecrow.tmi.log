[20:22] <natalietoday> @Lt_Shadow why'd you have to say that lmao
[20:22] <pommeline> rev please
[20:22] <standard_package> it's juice that hurts your bones
[20:22] <fangirlfridays> [Secret Meme]
[20:22] <squirrellilly> I have never even heard of the bone hurting juice
[20:22] <heyfa> literally every square but the worms was dug
[20:22] <flamingblizzard> ow owie ouch my bones
[20:22] <meaty_refrigerator37> @RevScarecrow its just an awful forced meme, a satire, if you will
[20:22] <appledoze> bone hurting juice is what back in the old 4chan days was called a forced meme
[20:22] <zombiehunter6022> is that a homestuck meme?
[20:23] <zimtard> i remember i helped cause a fandom meme about a mpreg blog and it was great

[20:23] <natalietoday> don't stop! keep injecting me those memes
[20:23] <theluigiguy> apparently it's an Anti-Memes
[20:23] <theluigiguy> yeah
[20:23] <squirrellilly> KYM says it is an anti-meme. So it is intended to be dumb
[20:23] <flametitan> Apparently it's supposed to be an *anti*-meme
[20:23] <tomokithecoffeecup> gud meme juice
[20:23] <theluigiguy> SourPls
[20:23] <zimtard> every meme is forced honestly
[20:23] <natalietoday> SourPls
[20:23] <meaty_refrigerator37> SourPls
[20:23] <tomokithecoffeecup> my existence is a forced meme
[20:23] <corencio> I'm against anti-memes. What if they disrupt the whole meme economy? WutFace
[20:23] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow speaking of memes people are making starbuckchan a thing
[20:23] <theluigiguy> WHAT
[20:24] <atleast3dolphins> When will " revWhatiswrongwithyou " be a meme
[20:24] <appledoze> tbh my favorite new memes are the star wars prequel memes, it really shows that weve come a long way, the star wars fans have finally reached the acceptance stage of grief and are now ironically enjoying the prequels
[20:24] <flamingblizzard> they still suck though

[20:45] <mentaljen> @RevScarecrow See what happens when you sell out for kinks Colin? People pay you 25 dollar to call you Daddy. Did you ever think this would be your life?
[20:46] <nick2424delcat> also hi jen
[20:46] <mentaljen> @Nick2424Delcat Hello
[20:46] <kevinmunchybuttons> Are you kink shaming when you have the same kink
[20:46] <morings> @MentalJen Sex sells
[20:46] <meaty_refrigerator37> @MentalJen this is serious shit, you're calling him colin
[20:46] <corencio> TehePelo
[20:46] <kevinmunchybuttons> jmfMom
[20:46] <chucklercheese> my mom mis-said "diamond in the rough" as "cherry in the rough" and now its a family meme
[20:46] <mentaljen> @meaty_refrigerator37 I always call him Colin.
[20:46] <meaty_refrigerator37> oh
[20:46] <morings> WHY would you expect that rev
[20:46] <purplelark> I caught My Summer Car through afterhours today. What happened during that stream is utter bull. Great decision with Stardew today!
[20:46] <zimtard> 100 dollar furry rev emote when?
[20:46] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow and we can now use it in your discord even with the bottom tier sub
[20:46] <mentaljen> I always refer to the streamers by their actual names because of formalities.

[20:47] <meaty_refrigerator37> !uptime
[20:47] <theluigiguy> revConcern
[20:47] <flametitan> @RevScarecrow I hope you appreciate the extra income you get from the $25 subs
[20:47] <weer_dough> You have brought this nightmare upon yourself.
[20:47] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow it would be smarter if the 10 sub gave the dy emote
[20:47] <mentaljen> @RevScarecrow It's kind of random I think maybe in the fire levels cause red?
[20:47] <place_holder> if we have to pay to call rev daddy does that make him a professional Dom?
[20:47] <nick2424delcat> but rev you are my fursona FeelsBadMan
[20:47] <kevinmunchybuttons> rubies are after level 81

[20:49] <natalietoday> i think it's 6
[20:49] <mentaljen> It definitely counts as more than 1
[20:49] <theluigiguy> I think Demetrius is gonna be at the bar
[20:49] <kevinmunchybuttons> aren't they all alcoholics?
[20:49] <corencio> It's Friday night, EVERYONE is at the bar
[20:49] <augustodonnell> it's friday so he does go to the bar with robin on the weekends
[20:49] <chucklercheese> does the sub last all those months?
[20:49] <stillabitgreen> he might be at the bar, i think him and robin go there sometimes
[20:49] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow it counts as 6
[20:49] <mentaljen> I have 92 subs I know that beekay subbed for 25 dollars and I have 98 points towards 125 sub points so I'm trying to figure it kevin just did it for 10 then...
[20:49] <theluigiguy> $24.99 / $9.99 subs are still 1 month
[20:50] <flametitan> Friday night is Bar night! Unless you're a kid

[20:50] <purplelark> I wish I could sub. I've been watching from after hours for a few months now
[20:50] <mentaljen> 25 dollar sub counts for like 5? and the 10 counts for 2
[20:50] <natalietoday> hey jeddo!
[20:50] <pommeline> that's not even sebastian
[20:50] <theluigiguy> Hi Jeddo OSkomodo /
[20:50] <natalietoday> yeah 10 is 2 and 25 is 6 iirc
[20:50] <theluigiguy> Rubies usually sell for $250 I think
[20:50] <1upjumpman> You can pay for subs month-to-month, or all t once for 3, 6, and 12 months
[20:50] <jeddostotle7> Hey Nat, hey Luigi, hey Jen!

[20:51] <1upjumpman> Pretty sure you can pay for a year
[20:51] <flametitan> I have an 16-17 year old cat on my lap. Express aw at her age
[20:51] <kevinmunchybuttons> shit, i should have
[20:51] <morings> I can't afford subbing right now either, so that's what i do, only if it's something small
[20:51] <minuecharm> My cat just left me
[20:51] <mentaljen> @Morings Everything helps though.
[20:52] <pommeline> @flametitan i LOVE her. she is so strong and beautiful
[20:52] <morings> Yep <3
[20:52] <purplelark> Already ahead of you, @Morings. I know Youtube ads don't bring in much, but I know it helps

[20:52] <mentaljen> It's nice to just see people in stream and talk to them. I like to talk to people while I'm streaming.

[20:52] <kevinmunchybuttons> Rev, we do it because we love you, hush and love us revWhyareyoulikethis revWhatiswrongwithyou
[20:52] <jeddostotle7> When I get an actual job (which seems likely to be soon, the LEGO Store called me back a couple days ago for a second interview on Monday), I'm seriously considering upping my sub to $25 a month so I can call Rev Daddy via emote
[20:52] <chucklercheese> i moved out so all my cats are at my parents house ;_;
[20:52] <waylonjsmithers> my 16 yo cat has been diagnosed with kidney failure and im super bummed

[20:53] <anxiouskiwi> You need 5 beans and a keg

[20:53] <rawketlawnchair0> You need 5 beans
[20:53] <pommeline> i love grumpy old lady cats. i have one of those

[20:54] <janekellyxcom> Yes, pufferfish are at the ocean
[20:54] <kevinmunchybuttons> At that point, you'd think they get like 3 jobs and do the grind

[20:55] <lt_shadow> Go back theres a worm near the lighting rod
[20:55] <mentaljen> We have quite a few people watching us and it's pretty cool.
[20:55] <wokebae420> i'm probably the kind who will die while creating content but will not blame people for not being able ot allow me to survive i mean, the only thing lost is me makin content
[20:55] <theluigiguy> :)
[20:56] <lt_shadow> Rev look worms
[20:56] <natalietoday> @Lt_Shadow pls no
[20:56] <chucklercheese> worms are cool as fuck. like in real life
[20:56] <lt_shadow> He wotn get them SwiftRage
[20:56] <kevinmunchybuttons> @MentalJen please karaoke dr dick for this years charity thing, i'll love you more than forever
[20:56] <lt_shadow> limesThump
[20:56] <1upjumpman> Ok I was wrong about 1-year subs. You can make payments at $4.99 per month, $14.97 for 3 months, and $29.94 for 6 months. But there are no savings at all so it's no harm buying mo-to-mo.
[20:56] <corencio> Most of the time worms are garbage. But they have a small chance to yield treasure, so....
[20:56] <moobot> Wanna have your fan art shown on stream? Post it here http://vinesauce.booru.org/ and Rev will show it at the end of the stream. Make sure to put "rev" tag so he can find it.
[20:57] <mentaljen> @kevinmunchybuttons I can definitely try. Maybe I can get someone to do a duet with me
[20:57] <wokebae420> if i go broke i'll be sure to go out with a blast and kill the proletariat and try to achieve socialism or die tryin

[20:58] <meaty_refrigerator37> i agree natalie \o/
[20:58] <topazshot88> Octopus is from 6 AM to 1 PM, Pufferfish is from Noon to 4 PM.

[20:58] <xardde> Wokebea I heard Venezuela is a really good socialist country
[20:58] <anxiouskiwi> Also, have you caught the crimsonfish yet?
[20:58] <wokebae420> @xArDDe Cuba is better actually

[20:59] <lt_shadow> @MentalJen How do you like the TF2 version?
[20:59] <docjackal2> THPS3
[20:59] <tintainiumcan> I remember very clearly

[20:59] <kevinmunchybuttons> Doesn't vinny still owe us a song from his charity intensives?
[20:59] <wokebae420> Dumb american idea of socialism is happening in dermark or sweden tho so thats good enough
[21:00] <theluigiguy> Yes Vinny still owes us Japanese Karaoke
[21:00] <mentaljen> @kevinmunchybuttons
[21:00] <mentaljen> Yes
[21:00] <tintainiumcan> This is one tricky fish
[21:00] <corencio> What
[21:00] <natalietoday> rip
[21:00] <topazshot88> Fishing Tackle exists for a reason, Rev
[21:00] <theluigiguy> NotLikeThis
[21:00] <sadistic_kitten> No worries no beef @wokebae420 just returning the rhetoric i am hearing from you
[21:00] <punstartracer> rip
[21:00] <anxiouskiwi> Use a good tackle and maybe eat some fish stew
[21:00] <corencio> This is probably the pufferfish. But what's that about Vinny and karaoke?
[21:00] <natalietoday> i was so hyped when i managed to finally catch the legendary ocean fish
[21:00] <xardde> Wokebea I cant really tell if you like it or not lol
[21:00] <place_holder> an epic battle of man verses sea
[21:01] <wokebae420> What Cuba? Cuba is okay, its decent at best
[21:01] <kevinmunchybuttons> Fishing mod exists for the same reason, for when you put in 100 hours and fishing is a problem for you ;p
[21:01] <saidin228> asshole fish
[21:01] <chucklercheese> i never noticed that
[21:01] <wokebae420> its not that bad as the fear mongering makes cuba make it seem

[21:02] <corencio> Stream it on a different website?
[21:02] <kevinmunchybuttons> @RevScarecrow is omegle the same way?
[21:02] <lt_shadow> What cite is this?
[21:02] <lt_shadow> Omegle?
[21:02] <shuuspillow> yeah i saw which is really fucked up
[21:02] <tintainiumcan> Didn't omegle become the alternative or is that just as bad now
[21:02] <asunz> What about something similar but with potentially less dicks?
[21:02] <flametitan> I think every random chat has become penises
[21:02] <punstartracer> Try shamechat or something like that
[21:02] <freshgiantofbelair> what year is rev on?
[21:02] <corencio> Well hey, if you record a video, you could censor it yourself
[21:02] <surewhynot000> those guys are jerks
[21:03] <sir_noobsly> penis seems to be the natural state of chat rooms
[21:03] <surewhynot000> get it? jerks?
[21:03] <comradebadlose> what did i just come to?
[21:03] <theluigiguy> Kappa
[21:03] <corencio> Jerkoffs, yes
[21:03] <place_holder> @RevScarecrow you could use that tag feature that omegle has now and have chat use that tag if you want to do something with omegal
[21:03] <freshgiantofbelair> what the fuck is happening
[21:03] <wokebae420> "You can't fuck someone masturbating" SINCE WHEN? Kappa
[21:03] <chucklercheese> those damn exhibitionists
[21:03] <kevinmunchybuttons> I mean i'm all down for having someone watch me, but i'm not desperate to stream myself for it, that's low af
[21:03] <corencio> Rev is fishing. SabaPing
[21:03] <shuuspillow> and they dont even show their faces sometimes rude af
[21:03] <nick2424delcat> @RevScarecrow to be fair, who wouldnt wanna jerk to daddy
[21:03] <atleast3dolphins> revWhatiswrongwithyou Gonna head out, have fun Rev.
[21:03] <sky8moon> you'll have to put a tag there for a fandom or something to get anyone that isn't jerking off
[21:03] <tintainiumcan> Kind of a shame that behaviour is so... idk predictable
[21:04] <agumonchampion3> Never played Stardew Valley, is it really that replayable & fun?
[21:04] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[21:04] <chucklercheese> ill bet theres guys jerking off who gets another guy jerking off and thats how they realised that they were gay
[21:04] <jeddostotle7> @atleast3Dolphins later, Dolphins
[21:04] <sky8moon> i thought tags worked for videos
[21:04] <natalietoday> i love s t a r d e w KappaHD
[21:04] <kevinmunchybuttons> You'd only get that jerkoff if no one else puts in the tag OR someone here is the jerkoff
[21:04] <natalietoday> (i think chat realizes this by now)
[21:04] <chucklercheese> you streaming it got me into it
[21:04] <comradebadlose> wait are we talking about chatroulette
[21:04] <theluigiguy> were
[21:05] <theluigiguy> Animal Tossing
[21:05] <flametitan> @comradebadlose And Omegle. Those families of chats
[21:05] <corencio> I have this problem where I played over 100 hours of Stardew and burnt out.
[21:05] <saginaim> Hi I just got here what's this about jerking off in Stardew Valley?
[21:05] <punstartracer> every videochat place is either a/s/l or people straight jerking off
[21:05] <shuuspillow> thats fucked up if they do invade random tagged videos with their dicks who is to say their own fam isnt on the other side
[21:05] <natalietoday> this is like the comfiest game on the planet right now
[21:05] <flametitan> I enjoyed it. It was a nice way to relax.
[21:05] <tintainiumcan> I had a go at Stardew, and though I need to give it another chance, it actually stressed me the hell out
[21:05] <tintainiumcan> Which is bizarre I know
[21:05] <agumonchampion3> I've never gotten into these sort of games, but I might try someday.
[21:06] <kevinmunchybuttons> I got about 100 and haven't finished it. I'll probably go back to it eventually
[21:06] <anxiouskiwi> According to steam I have 188 hours in SV
[21:06] <flametitan> I'm waiting for the Co-Op update
[21:06] <natalietoday> i'm at like 70-75 hours
[21:06] <kevinmunchybuttons> ^
[21:06] <tirien66> im waiting for better husbandos
[21:06] <kevinmunchybuttons> co op will be tight
[21:06] <anxiouskiwi> It just keeps going
[21:06] <corencio> Depends on how you define "beating" it
[21:07] <tirien66> there is a win, which is repair entire town, but theres no real end
[21:07] <kevinmunchybuttons> well yeah, what i mean by finishing it though is please grand revWhyareyoulikethis revWhatiswrongwithyou
[21:07] <kevinmunchybuttons> pleasing*
[21:07] <lajiaya> The main thing I dislike about this game is the combat with a M+KB.
[21:07] <queenofwaffles> lmao those emotes
[21:07] <chucklercheese> beating it Kappa
[21:07] <tirien66> basically do all the money things for jojomart or give the apple gremlins all the stuff
[21:07] <kevinmunchybuttons> I am
[21:07] <punstartracer> I have a 120h save file and i just want to have more wife's and husbands now
[21:07] <anxiouskiwi> There's an event measuring you progress at the beginning of year 3 (you can redo it if you fail) and I think that's the end of the 'story' but the game still keeps going ig you want
[21:07] <flametitan> @Corencio I read that in the context of the last conversation. I was mildly disturbed
[21:07] <sky8moon> well they did pay for it
[21:07] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow Twitch isn't letting me join the Daddy Tier right now :<
[21:07] <corencio> My work here is done KappaPride
[21:07] <kevinmunchybuttons> I laugh every time i get a chance to use them
[21:08] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow that sounded sincere Kappa
[21:08] <theluigiguy> LUL
[21:08] <shuuspillow> @natalietoday twitch is specifically kinkshaming u
[21:08] <tintainiumcan> That's the whole thing, even if it's basically arbritrary, having the entire game be on a timer is terrifying
[21:08] <weer_dough> Rev you don't sound very sorry.
[21:08] <tintainiumcan> Suddenly like everyday has to become perfectly efficient in my head
[21:08] <asunz> Same
[21:08] <inakicast> This game hace co-op already ? or its the same as 1 year ago ?
[21:08] <kevinmunchybuttons> Worm bin is new to me
[21:08] <rawketlawnchair0> This is bait.
[21:08] <sky8moon> makes bait
[21:08] <anxiouskiwi> Produces free bait
[21:08] <lajiaya> Gives you bait.
[21:08] <topazshot88> You put it down and every day get 2-5 bait.
[21:08] <meaty_refrigerator37> worms
[21:08] <corencio> It helps you bait KappaPride
[21:08] <corencio> Listen I can't
[21:08] <punstartracer> gives bait randomly
[21:08] <topazshot88> You can be pretty self-sufficient with crab pots.
[21:08] <shuuspillow> im curious, can u have a kid in this game?
[21:09] <corencio> You can have two
[21:09] <flametitan> @TintainiumCan In the early game you don't have the energy to spend the day efficiently

[21:09] <pommeline> i miss this game...i won it from a giveaway but it was like, 3 or 4 days before the new story of seasons came out. so i ended up dropping it to play a different farm game

[21:10] <flametitan> @TintainiumCan Best tip I have is don't try to do everything. Find one or two things and focus on that
[21:10] <meaty_refrigerator37> SourPls
[21:10] <punstartracer> SourPls
[21:10] <kevinmunchybuttons> I just went for an interview at a gamestop and talked to the manager about this game and saw the ps4 case of it
[21:10] <boybiue> SourPls
