[21:56] <glassbrain> It's Virtual Worlds, but it's filled with shitposters instead of a dedicated community who does a weird creepypasta thing.
[21:56] <to_yota> Did you make any VR friends since the last time?

[21:56] <saiaichan> To climb walls, you mash jump. To Float/glide, you mash a direction, like W for forward. Holding the run button lets you float further.

[21:59] <karatemanjoe> I've thrown up on rides like this twice
[21:59] <jonjon64mayor> Can your Olaf oc turn super saiyan
[21:59] <jarvybestelin> @RevScarecrow if you are seriously going to invest into VR Headsets you need to have a GTX 1060 or higher or equivalence. Other wise you will have alot of problems tbh
[21:59] <saibot872> nice google images texture
[21:59] <cytricacid> I have a bunch of monster hunter stories models ripped if someone wants to rig them for VR chat lmao
[21:59] <theluigiguy> @Japebroni you can just use mouse and keyboard
[21:59] <haroldhutchins> didney worl
[21:59] <wired_spyduck> oh my god this theme park seems like such a bad idea for a VR program
[21:59] <liltricksterkid> @Japebroni It gives you a option to do so
[21:59] <zetabyt> I can imagine this ride would fuck with you with VR
[21:59] <exyoh> Teacups are pretty placid. Unless they're called tubs. Those will kill the frail.
[22:00] <japebroni> @theluigiguy and things just work as normal?
[22:00] <dragoneye77> Rev you should play this with mike
[22:00] <wellthatsjust_peachy> w h a t are those huge muscle men
[22:00] <ararebeast> @RevScarecrow If you want Chuck E Cheese avatar back go to Worlds, search "avatar" and go to the one that's labeled an Avatar Garage. (I can't remember the name of WHOSE garage)
[22:00] <saiaichan> That ride really sucks if you're short
[22:00] <proably_xavier> Oh shirt diddley? (0. o )

[22:28] <liltricksterkid> thats not ash
[22:28] <nick2424delcat> I tyhink I just heard a redvox song
[22:28] <lemon_line> This is truly hell
[22:28] <desireeanime> the actual story is not cute
[22:28] <stikenir> THE MEME LORD WAS CLOSE
[22:28] <wilderbeast10> I saw yesterday's stream and from what I've seen today I still don't get what's going on here
[22:28] <ghostdisease> its not a cute manga at all
[22:28] <roarthelonewolf> this game is much cancer lol
[22:28] <xgreenflame> following punpun may be the worst idea
[22:28] <desireeanime> fuckin depressin

[22:28] <stikenir> This is like Roblox
[22:28] <tdogrulz99show> I knew it!!! Shara was following you!
[22:28] <lemon_line> Dude, Mario Kart 9 looks weird
[22:28] <ghostdisease> punpun is my absolute favorite manga
[22:28] <theluigiguy> rip LuL

[22:29] <japebroni> That shara dude tho
[22:29] <docjackal2> So that tiger person's just following us now, huh
[22:29] <lordvipes> So is this an even more crappy Second Life but in VR?
[22:29] <froodhoopy> rev is generic white man #4
[22:29] <tdogrulz99show> There's punpun
[22:29] <egbluh> Tommy lmao
[22:29] <fabix56> He saif on the right
[22:29] <jessikakill> there it was
[22:29] <samiam1616> I'm guessing this is much easier with a VR set
[22:29] <stikenir> @lordvipes minus the crazy people, plus shitposters.
[22:29] <armored_guy> dat flashlight

[22:29] <japebroni> Imagine having your life greatest achievement be imitating Tommy Wiseau
[22:29] <skinny_mario> I love the world design in this game
[22:29] <japebroni> LUL
[22:29] <docjackal2> @KineSaya Have I got news for you
[22:29] <buffprettyriku> moms spaggheti
[22:29] <glassbrain> @LordVipes You can do things in Second Life. Think more like those virtual world games that Vinny streamed and got spooked in.
[22:30] <liltricksterkid> looks unfinished
[22:30] <buffprettyriku> its pretty much worlds (2017)
[22:30] <liltricksterkid> Theres missing textured
[22:30] <spriteclad> is this roblox
[22:30] <lemon_line> Why are they jizzing cum all over the place?
[22:30] <theluigiguy> ofc Rev
[22:30] <fabix56> There is thr model, on the riht
[22:30] <exyoh> This is much closer to JanusVR than anything.
[22:30] <zombiehunter6022> @BuffPrettyRiku and gmod
[22:30] <tropicguin> jet cum
[22:30] <glassbrain> Again, roblox at least has a shitty counter-strike clone.
[22:30] <syrteaghue> I get not wanting stream snipers, but this game is arguably better with a group of people to pal around with. If you engage the stream snipers, then you can befriend some of the cool ones and drag them along with you to places.
[22:30] <liltricksterkid> yeah it's totes unfinished
[22:30] <natalietoday> oh
[22:31] <japebroni> I wonder if this game will get updated some day
[22:31] <theluigiguy> WutFace
