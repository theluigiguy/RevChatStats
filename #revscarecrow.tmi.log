[20:28] <theluigiguy> LUL
[20:28] <jadedbunny84> this might take a while
[20:28] <aquiradash> @RevScarecrow Hey Rev, did you know that there is a foundation that is dedicated to finding bigfoot in Texas? Are you a part of it?
[20:28] <fangirlfridays> Classic zombie speeds
[20:28] <dapoel> @RevScarecrow You can speed up if you like, and don't forget to press "N"
[20:28] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[20:28] <zombiehunter6022> @revscarecrow you can control one of your soldiers
[20:28] <theluigiguy> Castle under siege
[20:28] <flametitan> Zombie Conga line
[20:28] <jadedbunny84> zombies have all the time in the world
[20:28] <xblazingsoulx> Castle is the true enemy
[20:28] <theluigiguy> little will they know that the zombies are coming
[20:28] <squirralicious> omg
[20:29] <deluxer21> the zombies are coming, the zombies are coming!

[20:29] <ragodom> KKona MERRCAH
[20:29] <dln002> look at this cinematic framerate Kappa
[20:29] <aquiradash> @RevScarecrow Hey Rev, did you know that there is a foundation that is dedicated to finding bigfoot in Texas? Are you a part of it?
[20:29] <ydoc126> Yeah the zombies aren't gonna win this
[20:29] <dubtalia> Justice rains from the side
[20:29] <lt_shadow> Is this made by the same people who made totally accurate Battle Sim?
[20:29] <chucklercheese> rev5
[20:30] <deluxer21> They're being polite zombies
[20:30] <fangirlfridays> Single file zombies are rarely any good
[20:30] <jeddostotle7> @Lt_Shadow nope
[20:30] <lt_shadow> SeemsGood
[20:30] <anxiouskiwi> Nah
[20:30] <nathaniel108> @RevScarecrow I think you can press v when you're controlling a unit to give other units orders.
[20:30] <ydoc126> No
[20:30] <dapoel> Make the soldiers defend the castle, also , if you press the "n" key, you can nuke
[20:30] <egoangell> It's not the same devs
[20:30] <vaporagio> it's not
[20:30] <deluxer21> This feels like a ripoff of TABS
[20:30] <egoangell> It's way different deluxer
[20:30] <dapoel> @deluxer21 probably
[20:30] <glassbrain> TABS is made by other folks
[20:30] <egoangell> tabs is a meme joke game
[20:30] <elephantboyq> It is not made by the devs of TABS and Clustertruck.
[20:30] <veropunch> revConcern
[20:30] <robo1237> you are a rip off of tabs
[20:30] <xblazingsoulx> @RevScarecrow There is a nuke button to end battles
[20:30] <lt_shadow> loading fap 8% Kreygasm
[20:30] <coocoojax> Rev were you affected by the mailinator email?
[20:30] <shuuspillow> i have no idea whats going on but hello @everyone
[20:30] <aquiradash> @RevScarecrow Do you think the idea of zombies is dumb, or do you believe it can happen?
[20:30] <squirralicious> are u okay
[20:30] <deluxer21> Dat edge
[20:30] <xblazingsoulx> This is a great game, vinny played it
[20:30] <tomokithecoffeecup> what up my dudes
[20:30] <ydoc126> Rev do one million ww2 soldiers vs one million World War Two soldiers
[20:31] <eanisr> If you press "N" on a unit they get healed. Kappa
[20:31] <squirralicious> yikes
[20:31] <dapoel> I told you to use the discord browser version Rev
[20:31] <deluxer21> it's in BETA guys
[20:31] <deluxer21> JEEZ
[20:31] <theluigiguy> aren't there like furniture units
[20:31] <demonyms> its a beta fish
[20:32] <glassbrain> It all depends on the origin and nature of your zombies
[20:32] <elephantboyq> Well, zombie bugs exist
[20:32] <glassbrain> they can be fast, magically created, from some weird disease, fungus, etc.
[20:32] <lt_shadow> Put the soldiers in the city and surround it with zombies
[20:32] <anxiouskiwi> I mean I suppose a really fucked up strain of rabies could make people /act/ like zombies, but the whole needing to destroy the head thing wouldn't make sense. They'd be able to ignore pain and shit, but other injuries would still kill them.
[20:32] <glassbrain> not actually undead, fast, slow, destructible by head damage, etc.
[20:32] <shakecaine> They are too far
[20:33] <ydoc126> One us marine vs 10000 roman soldiers
[20:33] <aquiradash> @RevScarecrow How do you put on a gas mask with a beard? I'm curious because although I have long hair I've never had a beard and I imagine it would be frustrating
[20:33] <dapoel> bath salts makes people bite other's people's faces off, so close enough
[20:33] <deluxer21> Wait what
[20:33] <dapoel> yeah
[20:33] <dapoel> it happens in florida
[20:33] <xblazingsoulx> @RevScarecrow You put them all on different teams the army troopers will kill the knights
[20:33] <egoangell> Sunny Sunny with Sun Sun
[20:33] <squirralicious> wait what
[20:33] <glassbrain> You're fucked if you have magical zombies because idk if you've ever played dwarf fortress but you basically have to turn the entire body into pulp or they will
[20:33] <moobot> Check out Rev's latest video: Best of April 2017 - Rev [Vinesauce] http://bit.ly/REVplaylist
[20:33] <glassbrain> just not stop
[20:33] <squirralicious> mostly sunny w some sun?
[20:33] <deluxer21> I LIVE in florida dude
[20:33] <xblazingsoulx> Oh neverming
[20:33] <dagg215> Hi rev, I gashed my hand open 1/4" deep
[20:33] <demonyms> stories that basically focus on zombies being normal people being controlled by some sort of parasite and unable to control anything thats happening freaks me the fuck out tbh
[20:34] <deluxer21> Now I'm scared
[20:34] <shuuspillow> doesnt the brain send messages to the body parts? isnt that needed to feast on the undead? @anxiouskiwi
[20:34] <theluigiguy> DEUS VALT
[20:34] <theluigiguy> *vult
[20:34] <theluigiguy> fuck

[20:34] <lt_shadow> DAS VUALT
[20:34] <dapoel> @deluxer21 have you never read a piece of news that said a dude tried to bite anothers dude face off? If seen at least 2 different cases from reputable news sources
[20:34] <xblazingsoulx> @RevScarecrow Knights will turn into zombies after death
[20:34] <glassbrain> He's comin'
[20:34] <vaporagio> Do your best, soldier
[20:35] <nik12787> Hope you have good CPU, GPU, and other good parts to run this game well
[20:35] <glassbrain> "I'M COMIN BOYS"
[20:35] <deluxer21> I have literally never read that @Dapoel, and now I'm kind of scared of it
[20:35] <elephantboyq> The soldier is going to die instantly when he gets there.
[20:35] <jadedbunny84> one WW2 soldier to save the day
[20:35] <dapoel> @RevScarecrow zombis can infect other units and transform them

[21:39] <biggus_fishus> I think Pingu's accuracy was actually detrimental at close range, his shots were perfectly straight but he was missing a lot of them

[22:18] <kirbyfananonymous> Literally an episode of Botchamania.
[22:18] <legendcasque> @RevScarecrow Direct control a single Pingu and try to defeat packs of all your other units.
[22:18] <optimussuperior> Rather than nerfing, make a counter to the table
[22:19] <samiam1616> Maybe up its move speed a smidge
[22:19] <dhudfw> That's way too low. You shoulda taken away just one zero
[22:19] <elephantboyq> Now it's going to die immediately.
[22:19] <chrismign> taable not enough health
[22:19] <punstartracer> take away 2 zeros
[22:19] <thestridercomplex> give it a smol amount of speed
[22:19] <papanade69> Make move speed .00000001 for table so its not invisible
[22:19] <dhudfw> Table will die instantly
[22:19] <trekkie313> Nah it will last a bit
[22:20] <shybel22> #table has 0% accuracy

[22:35] <felix_wolf> Automatic toilets do that because they have a timer in them. If the sensor happens to break(AKA: Detect something for more than 5 minutes), it will automatically flush, and keep the light flashing indicating the sensor is malfunctioning.
[22:35] <optimussuperior> Pingu is the only counter to Table
[22:35] <vaporagio> don't shit on the clock, shit in the toilet

[22:36] <arch7134> Can the catapults do anything
[22:36] <iansolo45> I watched sour patch kids throw a pineapple at a girls care then the car became the pineapple
[22:37] <iansolo45> car*
[22:37] <deluxer21> The catapults can try to reduce the table's health

[22:38] <dapoel> Hmm, actually, with how high the tables damage is, could the table kill chuck?

[22:39] <veropunch> revConcern
[22:39] <legendcasque> Basically Chunk Norris has permanent Auto-Life like that dumbass final fight in Final Fantasy X.
[22:39] <jeddostotle7> @RevScarecrow What @Dapoel said. Maybe the Table's damage is high enough that it could override Chuck's regenerating health, and manage to kill him?
[22:39] <veropunch> i know how the chuck v chuck ends
[22:39] <thestridercomplex> Chuck V Chuck
[22:39] <kwimbob> & 1more Chuck

[22:40] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow it's still a golden knight
[22:40] <legendcasque> @RevScarecrow I saw before that when you controlled him when he was swamped by Pingus, their kills were going up, he was basically respawning.
[22:40] <natalietoday> ok there we go

[22:49] <jeddostotle7> LUL
[22:49] <legendcasque> And more chickens would not help them, as that would just mean there are more zombies.
[22:49] <miserypancake> so how many chickens do you need? we need the equilibrium ratio
[22:49] <dapoel> this is brilliant
[22:49] <archonzach> Phantom range
[22:49] <kwimbob> WutFace OH NO
[22:50] <theluigiguy> WutFace
[22:50] <noahisi> WutFace
[22:50] <natalietoday> @RevScarecrow now adjust the number of chickens?
[22:50] <optimussuperior> BULLET ZOMBIES
[22:50] <gunnerthe> They show up on the sides because there's no more room in the center, so it draws them to the nearest clear point
[22:50] <furiousfox12> moar chickens
[22:50] <dondoran85> @MiseryPancake I don't think it matters, no amount of chicken can beat two zombies
[22:50] <glasshat> Add ranged units against the zombies but on the chicken team
[22:50] <papanade69> Try a rock tossing zamb so that the rocks make new zambs
[22:50] <deluxer21> Rev you wanted to end the stream
[22:50] <dustyvixen> "last one for tonight"
[22:50] <moobot> You can buy shirts to support Rev here > http://bit.ly/RevShirt
[22:50] <rebelsrock99> 1 table vs 50000 chickens Kappa
[22:50] <kirbyfananonymous> Danger! Danger! GENOCIDE! Death The Crisis! DANGEROUS ZOMBIE! WutFace
[22:50] <skinny_mario> Max the amount of chickens.
[22:50] <miserypancake> shhhhhh dont tell him

[22:51] <dondoran85> this is amazing
[22:51] <rebelsrock99> LUL
[22:51] <legendcasque> Pingus aren't very smart on their own.
[22:51] <deluxer21> "some of the pingus are not shooting" BRBRBRBRBBR
[22:51] <optimussuperior> Pingu is a real hero

[22:52] <dondoran85> Rev, stop cheating
[22:52] <glasshat> zombies vs zombies
[22:52] <theluigiguy> RIP Pingu
[22:52] <dapoel> Pingus are just the best unit
[22:52] <papanade69> Pingus have too much health
[22:52] <theluigiguy> oh..
[22:52] <natalietoday> LUL
[22:52] <kwimbob> you're about to be the final Pingu WutFace
[22:52] <turnerscreen> WutFace
[22:52] <legendcasque> One Pingu controlled by Rev could wipe all the zombies, but ten AI Pingu are stupid and don't know the meaning of range.
