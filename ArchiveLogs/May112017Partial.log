[22:01] <scoops89> i got to tiger right now
[22:01] <will99222> TIGGER SHOW US YOUR BALLS
[22:01] <theluigiguy> Christopher Robin is a god among gods
[22:01] <stahlmagie> I've seen men die over less than this.
[22:01] <aiden_of_the_light> increase what Rev?
[22:01] <smileyshine> please show robin BegWan
[22:01] <acdcfreak216> this is madness!
[22:01] <miijhal> fuck you for not being psychic
[22:01] <serpenttucker> this isnt even the OG japanese version of the game. THAT was some shit
[22:01] <desertp> Kisama! SwiftRage
[22:01] <somerandomsatanic> Robin is the only god
[22:01] <pamyj1> @RevScarecrow Honestly, if this is Tigger, I'm afraid of whats next.

[22:01] <will99222> @serpenttucker same game, just a translation of the text. thats all.
[22:01] <khalum777> pretty similar imo
[22:01] <namelessrumia> üí©
[22:01] <playerziero> Tigger is that baby from part 4 after she learns her shit
[22:01] <somerandomsatanic> Rev pls no
[22:01] <shuuspillow> pull the tigger piglet
[22:02] <asticktree> @HallowedGuru Get someone to draw that
[22:02] <crimsongunrose> Robin is DIO
[22:02] <desertp> @HallowedGuru that was probably the most common art for this back in the day
[22:02] <jeddostotle7> @serpenttucker Rev's played both the Japanese and American versions, says there's no difference
[22:02] <kengion> Boss? He's a deity!
[22:02] <acdcfreak216> what does speed give you? swing speed?
[22:02] <hatenalinkable> "Boss"
[22:02] <salty_peanut> half
[22:02] <kingsableye> >Boss
[22:02] <theluigiguy> Once we get to Robin I'm putting Metal Gear Rising music on
[22:02] <somerandomsatanic> More like God
[22:02] <meaty_refrigerator37> halfway
[22:02] <vincessity> BOSS BATTLE
[22:02] <goldeneye101> Robin is Kars
[22:02] <delhueso> Boss
[22:02] <kingtwibz> http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Achtung_Baby id like to imagine that is throwing a baby
[22:02] <meaty_refrigerator37> >calling dark souls hard
[22:02] <saiaichan> you might get more points from owl than from tigger considering the back-to-back home run bonus
[22:02] <kingsableye> "Fuck you!" _Tigger probably
[22:02] <cutsnnuts> Dark souls look different
[22:02] <deathbringer507> You got half
[22:02] <thefocuswobbler> Rev, I came here so you can cheer me up. I've been having a rough day man and I look forward to you funnies
[22:02] <guy_of_wonder> Robin is God, Tigger is a God Hand
[22:02] <acdcfreak216> such cheerful music
[22:02] <desertp> Tigger is the Eldritch Familiar of the Elder God that is Christopher Robin.
[22:02] <simmer122> @RevScarecrow So what level do people use to farm points in this game?
[22:02] <sciiroz> You can do it rev!
[22:02] <deerslayer30000> BigBrother
[22:02] <armadilloflashfire> were talking about bosses in a winnie the pooh game something is wrong
[22:02] <grompy_grumpy> could you change a flashgame like a rom hack ? revConcern
[22:02] <kengion> Robin will probably be as broken as Gold Experience Requiem
[22:02] <adamsker> whats the 100% WR for this
[22:02] <zalapros> i wonder how hard Christopher robin is?
[22:03] <desertp> He's nigh impossible Zalapros
[22:03] <delhueso> kids aren't supposed to play this game to the final boss, where you have to fight god and decide to save or destroy humanity
[22:03] <guy_of_wonder> Robin is god

[22:03] <theluigiguy> can we get this at SGDQ
[22:03] <will99222> @RevScarecrow if you do it on owl you get a consecutive back to back home run bonus to grind up
[22:03] <punstartracer> This is the run
[22:03] <morings> speedrun of this....how
[22:03] <seebutts> tigger is to christopher robin as pokey is to giygas

[22:04] <jeddostotle7> @RevScarecrow Apparently there's a back-to-back home run bonus
[22:04] <maverickbuggy> poeple probably have spread sheets on this game

[22:45] <enragedbullfrog> Defeating Christopher Robin does not require skill or learning. It requires a perfect oneness with reality - true enlightenment, and the ascension to the realms beyond.

[22:50] <sciiroz> I can't believe this game is supposed to be for children
[22:50] <epee_em> Tigger is the angel guarding hell's gate.
[22:50] <blazing_falken> Robin isn't god. Robin is Satan
[22:50] <androidpriest> tigger is the proverbial Cerberus at the gates of Hades, turning away those too faint-hearted to look Death himself in the eyes and challenge him
[22:50] <kevinmunchybuttons> so then is pooh jesus?
[22:50] <vaporagio> Has anyone actually beaten the game? Genuinely curious

[22:51] <a_random_canadian> That's the usual reaction to my puns, Morings.
[22:51] <specturtle> the best part of this game is when you dont have enough chances left to make the goal and the game still forces you to run the rest of the match

[22:54] <legendcasque> @RevScarecrow Open the game again to see if your progress is tracked. If it is, you can F5 to escape dead runs.
[22:54] <2hypercubed> You can do it!
[22:54] <pancakemisery> after seeing what goes on in the discord idk why you thought this would be a deterent

[22:54] <goat___boy> Roman Reigns beat this in his first try
